Currently, Chinese liquor identification systems are limited and have a single application that can distinguish only one nature of flavor type and production area. Four chemical reagents were successfully used to build this 3 x 1 simple colorimetric sensor array. This is the first time that a highly accurate colorimetric Chinese liquor sensor array was fabricated using only a few array points. It could distinguish four types of Chinese base liquors from Luzhou Laojiao, nine types of Chinese liquors with different flavor types, and seven types of Chinese liquors from different geographical origins. In order to ensure the accuracy, seven parallel samples were analyzed with water used as a control. PCA proved this sensor array to be effective. In LDA and HCA, every group was clearly classified. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was applied with 100% prediction ability in the three experiments. According to the results of the PCA, HCA, LDA, and the leave-one-out method, we can deduce that this colorimetric sensor array with multiple applications has great performance in discriminating Chinese liquors.",1759-9660,1759-9679,WOS:000393101900017,,

Five different Chinese liquors, namely, Baiyunbian, Beijing Erguotou, Red Star Erguotou, Zhijiangdaqu and Jianliliangjiu, alcohol and diluted alcohol (forged liquor) were measured. Though the main ingredient is alcohol in liquors, Chinese liquors mainly differ from their flavour types, which rely on their trace components. Flavour type of liquors is a very important factor in Chinese liquor identification. Principal component analysis incorporating with discriminant analysis (PCA-DA), back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) were compared for their classification ability. The accuracy of PCA-DA, BP-ANN and LVQ in terms of predicting tested samples was 76.8, 71.4 and 89.3%, respectively. The LVQ is the most suitable pattern recognition algorithm in present experiment.

Accurate identification of Chinese liquor flavors is not always possible through professional sommeliers' subjective assessment. A novel polymer piezoelectric sensor electric nose (e-nose) can be applied to distinguish Chinese liquors because of its excellent ability in imitating human senses by using sensor arrays and pattern recognition systems. The sensor, based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) principle is comprised of a quartz piezoelectric crystal plate sandwiched between two specific gas-sensitive polymer coatings. Chinese liquors are identified by obtaining the resonance frequency value changes of each sensor using the e-nose. However, the QCM principle failed to completely account for a particular phenomenon: we found that the resonance frequency values fluctuated in the stable state. For better understanding the phenomenon, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation using the finite volume method is employed to study the influence of the flow-induced forces to the resonance frequency fluctuation of each sensor in the sensor box. A dedicated procedure was developed for modeling the flow of volatile gas from Chinese liquors in a realistic scenario to give reasonably good results with fair accuracy. The flow-induced forces on the sensors are displayed from the perspective of their spatial-temporal and probability density distributions. To evaluate the influence of the fluctuation of the flow-induced forces on each sensor and ensure the serviceability of the e-nose, the standard deviation of resonance frequency value (SDF) and the standard deviation of resultant forces (SDFy) in y-direction (Fy) are compared. Results show that the fluctuations of Fy are bound up with the resonance frequency values fluctuations. To ensure that the sensor's resonance frequency values are steady and only fluctuate slightly, in order to improve the identification accuracy of Chinese liquors using the e-nose, the sensors in the sensor box should be in the proper place, i.e., where the fluctuations of the flow-induced forces is relatively small. This plays a significant reference role in determining the optimum design of the e-nose for accurately identifying Chinese liquors.",,1424-8220,MEDLINE:27775622,27775622,

The sensor, based on the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) principle is comprised of a quartz piezoelectric crystal plate sandwiched between two specific gas-sensitive polymer coatings. Chinese liquors are identified by obtaining the resonance frequency value changes of each sensor using the e-nose. However, the QCM principle failed to completely account for a particular phenomenon: we found that the resonance frequency values fluctuated in the stable state. For better understanding the phenomenon, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation using the finite volume method is employed to study the influence of the flow-induced forces to the resonance frequency fluctuation of each sensor in the sensor box. A dedicated procedure was developed for modeling the flow of volatile gas from Chinese liquors in a realistic scenario to give reasonably good results with fair accuracy. The flow-induced forces on the sensors are displayed from the perspective of their spatial-temporal and probability density distributions. To evaluate the influence of the fluctuation of the flow-induced forces on each sensor and ensure the serviceability of the e-nose, the standard deviation of resonance frequency value (SDF) and the standard deviation of resultant forces (SDFy) in y-direction (F-y) are compared. Results show that the fluctuations of Fy are bound up with the resonance frequency values fluctuations. To ensure that the sensor's resonance frequency values are steady and only fluctuate slightly, in order to improve the identification accuracy of Chinese liquors using the e-nose, the sensors in the sensor box should be in the proper place, i.e., where the fluctuations of the flow-induced forces is relatively small. This plays a significant reference role in determining the optimum design of the e-nose for accurately identifying Chinese liquors.",,1424-8220,WOS:000386131600187,,

However, these e-noses using classic dynamic sampling (CDS) method consume quite long sampling time. In this paper, a novel bio-inspired breathing sampling (BBS) method is proposed to shorten the sampling time. The proposed BBS is a bionic multi-stage sampling method that imitates the biological process of continuous short breathings. Based on the CDS and BBS methods, the same data processing procedures are employed to process the sampled data. Compared with the CDS, the sampling time of the BBS is much shorter and the extracted features of the BBS are simpler. To test the performance of the two sampling methods, three classification methods are employed to identify seven kinds of Chinese liquors using the self-designed electronic nose.

A combination of physiological and functional analyses revealed a very high diversity of yeast populations. In particular, the extremely high temperature and low acidity of the fermentation conditions led to an accumulation of species with distinctive heat- and acid-resistant properties. Moreover, these yeast species were also significant flavour contributors, for various alcohols, acids and esters. Conclusions: The Chinese Maotai-flavour liquor-fermentation process is rich in yeast resources with distinctive fermentation properties, which were different from other beverages.

Quantitative analysis using the correlation coefficient method showed that there were high correlations among different batches of Hai-Zhi-Lan liquor (>= 0.99).

However, the product from sweet sorghum stalks was lacking in volatile flavors, and the level of harmful contents were uncertain, therefore it could not be sold as liquor. In this study, the protein, fat, and tannin in the clusters and leaves of sweet sorghum were utilized to increase the content of flavor compounds in the ethanol product through the anaerobic fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meanwhile, the silage fermentation method was used to extend the preservation time of the raw materials and to further enhance the flavors of Fen-flavor liquor, with ethyl acetate as the characteristic flavor. The effects of different feedstock groups on ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, methanol, acetaldehyde, acetal, fusel oil, total acid, and total ester were evaluated by analyzing the chemical composition of different parts of sweet sorghum and determined by gas chromatograph. The effect of different fermentation periods on the volatile flavor of sweet sorghum Baijiu was evaluated. The yield of the characteristic volatile flavor was increased by the extension of the fermentation time.

In order to enhance the correct identification rate of six kinds of Chinese liquors using electronic nose (E-nose), a Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) method based on kernel entropy component analysis (KECA) was introduced. Based on this method, the influence of different features combination representation types of E-nose signals on the discrimination result of six kinds of Chinese liquors was studied in-depth. Firstly, integral value (INV), variance (VAR), relative steady-state average value (RSAV), average differential value (ADV) and wavelet energy value (WEV) of E-nose signals were extracted as five kinds of feature values, and the FDA result of each single feature showed that the identification result based on INV, AVRS and WEV was superior to that of the other two features, respectively. Thus the features INV, AVRS and WEV were selected as subsequent analysis features. Then, for the features of INV, AVRS and WEV, when the E-nose signals were represented by random combinations based on two features or three features combination, FDA results displayed that the identification results of multi-features combinations were better than that of single feature, especially the three features combination was the best. Finally, on the premise of combining the three features to represent electronic nose signals, and the discrimination result of six kinds of Chinese liquors was deeply investigated by an introduced KECA+FDA. When the radial basis function (RBF) was selected as kernel transform function, with the help of a measuring method of matrix similarity based on Euclidean distance, the characteristic parameter of RBF was defined, which was 16.860 8. And the correct identification rate of the test set samples was from 79.92% of FDA up to 100% of the KECA+FDA. Meanwhile, the discrimination result of KECA+FDA was better than that of BP neural network and support vector machine. This indicated that the KECA+FDA method can effectively improve the identification ability of the six kinds of Chinese liquors; at the same time, it also provided a feasible pattern recognition method for the identification of complex samples such as Chinese liquors by electronic nose in the future.",1000-1298,,CSCD:6220884,,

Ethyl caproate, an ethyl ester eliciting apple-like flavor, is one of the most important esters in the strong aromatic Chinese liquor (or Luzhou-flavor liquor), which is the most popular and best-selling liquor in China. In the traditional fermentation process, ethyl caproate in strong aromatic liquor is mainly produced by aroma-producing yeast, bacteria, and mold with high esterification abilities in a mud pit at later fermentation stages at the expense of both fermentation time and grains rather than by the ethanol-fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To increase the production of ethyl caproate by Chinese liquor yeast (S. cerevisiae AY15) and shorten the fermentation period, we constructed a recombinant strain EY15 by overexpressing EHT1 (encoding ethanol hexanoyl transferase), in which FAA1 (encoding acyl-CoA synthetases) was deleted. In liquid fermentation of corn hydrolysate and solid fermentation of sorghum, ethyl caproate production by EY15 was remarkably increased to 2.23 and 2.83 mg/L, respectively, which were 2.97- and 2.80-fold higher than those of the parental strain AY15.

The results of high-throughput sequencing and statistical analysis showed that temperature had an influence on the bacterial community structure and the diversity index of the fermenting grains. The relative abundance of some bacterial genera in fermenting grains varied greatly with temperature. The diversity index of the bacterial community structure of the fermenting grains generally increased with temperature. In the early stages of fermentation (within 20 days), temperature had a significant influence on bacterial community structure and on the diversity index of the fermenting grains, while at the last stage of fermentation (after 20 days), temperature had a lesser effect. Ester determination results showed that temperature had a significant influence on the ester generation of fermenting grains. Low temperature was beneficial for generating total esters, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, and ethyl caproate, whereas a high temperature was beneficial for generating ethyl lactate in the fermenting grains. The results of a correlation analysis showed that at different temperatures, the species and quantity of bacteria having a significant correlation regarding ester generation were very different.",0361-0470,1943-7854,WOS:000526672100001,,

It is therefore necessary to control the Streptomyces community during liquor fermentation. Biological control, using the native microbiota present in liquor making, appears to be a better solution than chemical methods. The objective of this study was to isolate native microbiota antagonistic toward Streptomyces spp. and then to evaluate the possible action mode of the antagonists. Fourteen Bacillus strains isolated from different Daqu (the fermentation starter) showed antagonistic activity against Streptomyces sampsonii, which is one of the dominant geosmin producers. Bacillus subtilis 2-16 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 1-45 from Maotai Daqu significantly inhibited the growth of S. sampsonii by 57.8% and 843% respectively, and effectively prevented the geosmin production in the simulated fermentation experiments (inoculation ratio 1:1). To probe the biocontrol mode, the ability of strain 2-16 and 1-45 to produce antimicrobial metabolites and to reduce geosmin in the fermentation system was investigated. Antimicrobial substances were identified as lipopeptides by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem electrospray ionization/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-EST/Q-TOF MS) and in vitro antibiotic assay. In addition, strains 2-16 and 145 were able to remove 45% and 15% of the geosmin respectively in the simulated solid-state fermentation.

However, few studies are reported for environmental assessment of Chinese liquor production. A lot of material consumptions in Chinese liquor industries often bring about serious environmental pollution. Thus, Chinese strong aromatic liquor (CSAL) is taken as a representative for the environmental issues assessment of Chinese liquor industry in view of cleaner production (CP). The assessment is performed for the brewing system of CSAL including three main phases: crude liquor brewing, crude liquor blending, and steam production, which addresses resource and energy consumptions and environmental impacts. The results indicate that, according to the standards of Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, the consumptions of materials and energy are acceptable while the water consumption is higher than the requirement. Moreover, the discharge of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the brewing phase is above the standard requirement and contributes much to eutrophication. The total environmental impacts in the blending phase are less than those in the brewing and steam production phases. In detail, in the brewing phase, high concentration of volatile organic compounds in the wastewater results in the odor threshold values and photochemical ozone creation. In the blending phase, the main environmental impact is eutrophication owing to the wastewater. In the steam production phase, the most and least significant impacts are global warming and soot emission, respectively, wherein waste gas emission is dominated. Cost analysis reveals that when the water consumption and COD discharge meet the requirements according to the CP option, there are plenty of economic and environmental benefits for the CSAL industry.

The support vector machine (SVM) models were built by different ion selection methods, PLS regression coefficients, PLS X-loading, PCR regression coefficients, and PCR X-loading. Of these, the optimal SVM model was achieved with ions (m/z 112, 134, 140, 162, 167, 168, 175, 187, and 191) selected by PLS regression coefficients, whose prediction accuracy for the validation set was up to 92.6%. The overall results indicated that the PIS regression coefficients was a powerful way for selecting effective ion variables and mass spectrometry combined with SVM could well discriminate the quality grade of liquor.

Thousands of volatiles have been identified for the unique aroma profile. Among them, fatty acid esters have been identified as the main contributors to the aroma profile. In addition, many non-ester minor compounds, many of which are more polar than the esters, have been identified to contribute to the characteristic aroma unique to Wuliangye baijiu. The analysis of these minor compounds has been challenging due to the dominance of esters in the sample. Thus, it is desirable to fractionate the aroma extract into subgroups based on functional group or polarity to simplify the analysis. This study attempts a new approach to achieve simultaneous volatile extraction and fractionation using tandem LiChrolut EN and silica gel solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns. A baijiu sample (10 mL, diluted in 40 mL of water) was first passed through the LiChrolut EN (1.0 g) column. The loaded LiChrolut EN column was then dried with air and coupled with a silica gel (5.0 g) SPE column with anhydrous Na2SO4 (10.0 g) in between. The volatile compounds were eluted from the LiChrolut EN column and simultaneously fractionated on the silica gel column based on polarity. The simultaneous extraction and fractionation technique enabled the fractionations of all fatty acid esters into less polar fractions. Fatty acids, alcohols, pyrazines, furans, phenols, hydroxy esters, and other polar compounds were collected in more polar fractions. This technique was used to study the volatile compounds in Wuliangye, Moutai, and Fengjiu baijiu. In addition to fatty acid esters, many minor polar compounds, including 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, p-cresol, and 2-acetylpyrrole, were unequivocally identified in the samples.

In the Daqu making stage, few yeast strains accumulated. However, the stacking fermentation stage accumulated nine yeast species with different physio-biochemical characteristics. But only four species kept dominant until liquor fermentation, which were Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia membranifaciens, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, implying their important functions in liquor making. The four species tended to inhabit in different locations of the stack and pits during stacking and liquor fermentation, due to the condition heterogeneity of the solid-state fermentation, including the different fermentation temperature profiles and oxygen density in different locations.

For this purpose, based on reversed phase/strong anion-exchange mixed-mode column (ProElut (TM) PXA), a novel solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up method followed by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) quantification was developed to detect OTA in Chinese liquors. Meanwhile, the matrix effects were evaluated by using the post-extraction spiked method with the signal suppression/enhancement (SSE) as the evaluation index. Under the optimized conditions, no matrix effects were found due to the SSE values below 20%, and the external standard method can be used to determine OTA in Chinese liquors.

The results showed that the quality of different batches of Haizhilan spirit was consistent in the experimental wavelength interval. The correlation coefficient of ultraviolet spectral original data and the moving window correlation coefficient spectral were all above 0.99. The processing techniques and raw materials of Haizhilan spirit and the other series of Yanghe spirits belonging to the same company had a higher similarity.

The moving window method could effectively improve the spectral detail differences, highlight the shape, intensity and trend differences of the spectral feature bands, so it could enhance the ability of the experimental spectra to identify and analyze the fine structure. After an overall investigation, the moving window correlation coefficient combined with ultraviolet feature spectra (270 similar to 295 nm) improved the differences among Yanghe spirits, and then Haizhilan spirit could be discriminated from the other Yanghe spirits with high similarities.

Urease-producing strains or crude urease were mixed with fermented grains to reduce the content of urea during fermentation. Three urease-producing strains were isolated from Daqu,characterized as Staphylococcus saprophyticus. But addition of Staphylococcus saprophyticus strains had no significant effect on urea decrease in the solid-state fermentation,while addition of Lactobacillus reuteri or the crude urease thereof eliminated urea in fermented grains. Compared with commercial urease,urease produced by Lactobacillus reuteri showed better removal effect for urea in fermented grains with removal rate of 100%. When Lactobacillus reuteri at a concentration higher than 10~7 CFU/g was added into fermented grains,the removal rate of urea was higher than 97.3%. The removal rate of urea was higher than 77.4% when the amount of crude urease at a concentration higher than 25 U/kg was added into fermented grains.

However, there is no quantitative method to uncover the distribution of Lactobacillus sp. among different production locations. [Objective] This study aimed to build a quantitative method to uncover the distribution Lactobacillus sp. among different Chinese liquor production locations. [Methods] Specific primers were designed based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, and the specificity was verified by PCR. The qPCR reaction procedure was further optimized to increase amplification efficiency and reveal the distribution of Lactobacillus sp. [Results] A pair of specific primers were designed and validated, its amplification product size was 445 bp. By optimizing annealing and extension conditions, a three-step qPCR quantitative method was developed with independent denaturation, annealing and extension process. The amplification linearity of this method was strong (R2>0.99). The sensitivity was high, the quantitative limit was 17.9 copies/muL. The repeatability was well, the coefficient of variation of Ct value was less than 1%. Following and detecting the representative fermentation system from 10 producing locations in China, Lactobacillus sp. presented in 8 producing areas. In the different making process samples from the same region, Lactobacillus sp. was detected but its content was significantly different. The content of Lactobacillus sp. from sesame aroma fermentation system in Weifang, Shandong province was the highest (7.270.04 lgcopies/g). The growth curve of Lactobacillus sp. in this system was divided into two stages: the growth stage (0 to 15 d) and the stable stage (15 to 45 d).

Saccharomyces cerevisiae simultaneously transforms the sugars to ethanol and flavor compounds. The saccharification rate plays an important role in regulating the liquor yield and flavor profile. This work investigated the effect of saccharification rate on fermentation by regulating the inoculation ratio (1:0.1, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:5, 1:10) of S. cerevisiae and Aspergillus oryzae, the main saccharification agent. We found no significant difference in reducing sugar content among the mixed cultures with different ratios. This indicated a balance of the saccharification rate and the sugar consumption rate, in which the former was controlled by the interaction between A. oryzae and S. cerevisiae, and the latter controlled the metabolism of the two species. The ethanol yield was the highest in ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:5, while the total production of flavor compounds was the highest for the ratio of 1:0.5, which was mainly attributed to the vigorous metabolism of S. cerevisiae. The inoculum ratio of 1:10 produced the second highest content of flavor compounds in which a large number of alcohols and esters were derived from the vigorous metabolism of A. oryzae. This indicated that the saccharification rate significantly influenced the flavor metabolism. This study improves understanding of the interaction and cooperation between A. oryzae and S. cerevisiae in co-culture fermentation for Chinese liquor making.

Forty-two Baijiu samples among six brands with three flavors were prepared, and their fluorescence spectra were analyzed with an excitation light of 374.2 nm. Hexanoic acid and ethyl butyrate were found to have an impact on Baijiu fluorescence. The properties of lifetimes in Baijiu were investigated, and its mechanism was studied by calculations through density function theory. Using parameters of fluorescence lifetimes, Baijiu samples were classified according to their flavors. Additionally, the correlations between fluorescence lifetimes and storage time of Baijiu in Luzhou flavor were obtained, leading to a reliable and efficient method to establish the year forecast model of Chinese Baijiu with a mean error of 2.79 months. It also provides an important reference of the utility of time-resolved fluorescence for quantitative research of multi-component systems.

This absorption activity is according to the pi-pi stacking interactions between phthalates and the graphene working electrode which allows direct sampling and analyte preconcentration. The absorption of phthalates retards the interfacial electron-transfer kinetics and increases the charge-transfer resistance (R-ct). Numerical values of R-ct were extracted from a simulation of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra with the corresponding equivalent circuit. Cathodic polarization was employed prior to EIS measurements to effectively eliminate the metal ion interference.

The results showed that geosmin appeared in all the fermented sorghums at different fermentation periods. About 57% geosmin in the fermented sorghums was distilled into liquor. During the distillation process, the peak of geosmin concentration appeared when alcohol content was 50-60% vol. More importantly, high geosmin content was observed during the Daqu-making process. Furthermore, five Streptomyces strains were isolated from different types of Daqu used for the fermentation of light-aroma type liquor.

But the standards about the years of the product have a greater randomness. Therefore, to establish a technical standard of liquor's year has become desperately needed in order to regulate the industry and the market. Based on three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the original degree Chinese liquors with different years, which belongs to a well-known series in China, this article establishes a year forecast model of Chinese liquors. The research contents and innovations are as follows: firstly, from the analysis of correlation between the fluorescence spectra and the liquor's year, it is found that the correlation coefficient of three-dimensional fluorescence spectra between 0. 5 year and others reaches to 0. 811 4. The year information in the original spectra are mainly distributed in the area of the excitation wavelength of 200 similar to 230 and 250 similar to 320 nm and the emission wavelength in the band of 400 similar to 500 nm. The year information of the derivative spectrum distributes widely and its dispersion is high, in which the two order derivative spectra of the year information distribute more discrete. Secondly, the correlations of the two-dimensional fluorescence spectra with the excitation wavelength of 300 nm is studied. The results show that there is a high multicollinearity in the original fluorescence spectra. The value of the correlation coefficient is close to 1, in the whole range of the emission wavelength of 400 similar to 600 nm. The resolution capability can be improved after derivation, and the multicollinearityal so can be reduced at this time. Two order derivative has a better effect on the suppression of multicolinearity while most of the correlation coefficient are less than 0. 6. Finally, the year forecast model of the Chinese liquors is established with the excitation wavelength of 300 nm using quantum genetic algorithm and wavelet neural network. The concept of spectral modeling information density is proposed. It is found that the error of the root mean square of original spectra in the prediction reaches to 5. 4 years. The modeling effect is the worst. The main reason for this is that the original spectrum has a serious of multicollinearity, which leads to the correlation between the spectra and the year are not significant and the changes are slowly. The derivation spectra have a higher information density and a better effect of modeling than the original spectra. The validation set correlation coefficient of the second derivative spectra can reach to 0. 999 8, and the error of the year forecast is 0. 79 years. The research results provide not only a convenient optical method for the year calibration of the liquor, but also an important reference for the fluorescence spectra research of the multi-component gradient system.",1000-0593,,WOS:000401880000019,,

In this study, for ethyl acetate yield regulation, we finely modulated the expression of ATF1 through precise and seamless insertion of serially truncated PGK1 promoter from the 3' end by 100bp steps in the Chinese liquor yeast, CLy12a. The three engineered promoters carrying 100-, 200-, and 300-bp truncations exhibited reduced promoter strength but unaffected growth. These three promoters were integrated into the CLy12a strain, generating strains CLy12a-P-100, CLy12a-P-200, and CLy12a-P-300, respectively. The transcription levels of CLy12a-P-100, CLy12a-P-200, and CLy12a-P-300 were 20%, 17%, and 10% of that of CLy12a-P, respectively. The AATase (alcohol acetyl transferases, encoded by the ATF1 gene) activity of three engineered strains were 36%, 56%, and 62% of that of CLy12a-P. In the liquid fermentation of corn hydrolysate at 30 degrees C, the concentration of ethyl acetate in CLy12a-P-100, CLy12a-P-200, and CLy12a-P-300 were reduced by 28%, 30%, and 42%, respectively, compared to CLy12a-P.

Two experimental groups were studied, in which W. anomalus Y3604 (Group A) and YF1503 (Group B) were added, respectively; in the control group (Group C), no W. anomalus was added. Adding strain Y3604 increased the content of esters in fermentation samples, especially ethyl acetate and ethyl caproate, and reduced the content of higher alcohols. Adding strain YF1503 had little effect on the ester content but decreased the content of higher alcohols.

The correlations of genera in Group A or B samples were simple compared with group C. Although the predominant eukaryotic genera in the three groups were consistent, the abundance of each gene varied among groups.

The liquor prepared without SSS had a cheese-like flavor. It was confirmed that the cheese-like flavor derived from butanoic acid was only detected in the liquor prepared without SSS. SSS facilitated the biosynthesis of beta-phenylethyl alcohol and ethyl lactate by supplying a large amount of phenylalanine and lactic acid at the initial stage of fermentation, and it prevented contamination.

This novel functional magnetic adsorbent was characterized using various techniques. Using the prepared material as adsorbents, a magnetic solid-phase extraction method coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography was proposed for determining four phthalate esters in Chinese liquor samples. The extraction parameters, including solution pH, adsorbent amount, extraction time, and eluent type and volume, were optimized. Under the optimized conditions, proposed method showed good linearity within the range of 1.53-200 mu g/L for diphenyl phthalate, 2.03-200 mu g/L for butyl benzyl phthalate, 7.02-200 mu g/L for diamyl phthalate, and 6.03-200 mu g/L for dicyclohexyl phthalate, with correlation coefficients > 0.9944, low limits of detection (0.46-2.10 mu g/L, S/N = 3), and good extraction repeatability (relative standard deviations of 3.7%, n = 6). This method was successfully used to analyze phthalate esters in Chinese liquor samples with recoveries of 74.4-104.8%. Two phthalate esters were detected in two samples, both at concentrations that satisfied the Chinese national standard, indicating this method has practical application prospects.

Here, we revealed the bioturbation effect of fortified Daqu on microbial community based on taxonomic composition, co-occurrence network, and metabolic potential, using Chinese strong-flavor liquor fermentation as a microecosystem. According to principal coordinate analysis, microbial communities were obviously influenced by the bioturbation of fortified Daqu. More specifically, bioturbation increased the abundances of Caproiciproducens, Clostridium, Aspergillus, Candida, Methanobacteriwn, and Methanosarcina, while decreased that of Lactobacillus. Meanwhile, higher abundances of most genes that encoding enzymes involved in interspecies hydrogen transfer between hexanoic acid bacteria and methanogens were observed in the bioturbated ecosystem by PICRUSt approach. Additionally, co-occurrence analysis showed that bioturbation increased the diversity and complexity of interspecies interactions in microecosystem, which contributed to higher production of flavor metabolites such as hexanoic acid, ethyl hexanoate, and hexyl hexanoate.

The difficulty of these classifications is how to get the information of the trace components in these samples. In this paper a method for liquor recognition based on liquid evaporation was presented. This method makes use of the distinct evaporation characteristics of different components in liquor samples. And during the evaporation process, one metal oxide gas sensor was used to detect the headspace of liquor samples for classification. Due to the distinct evaporation characteristics of different components, volatile compounds in the headspace evaporating from samples would change with the testing time. Meanwhile, the gas sensor would respond to these volatile compounds. Accordingly, more information of liquor samples during evaporation may be acquired with the proposed method. To verify the performance of this method, 8 different Chinese liquors with 50% alcohol for comparison were tested under the method. The results showed that the evaporation characteristics of these liquor samples were quite distinct.

A dynamic alteration of the bacterial populations at different stages of fermentation was determined through a 2-y continuous monitoring. The physicochemical parameters of Daqu at different fermentation stages were investigated by weighing, NaOH titration, and HCl hydrolysis together with Fehling reagent methods. Furthermore, infrared spectral analysis using Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy was performed to determine physicochemical changes of Daqu. Therefore, our studies provide key insight for a comprehensive quality control of Daqu at different fermentation stages using the PCR-DGGE analysis combined with the physicochemical measurement.Practical Application Chinese liquor is one of the 6 well-known distilled spirits in the world. High-temperature Daqu acts as an important source of nutrients and of microorganisms in the solid-state fermentation of Chinese Moutai-flavor liquor, which has a critical impact on the final flavor of the liquor. The study identifies a novel DGGE marker and provides an efficient way to identify bacterial diversity in Daqu from different fermentation stages.

[Methods] Culture-independent (internal transcribed spacer amplicons and metatranscriptomics sequencing) and culture-dependent (strain selection and simulated fermentation experiments) technologies were used to analyze the structural change of yeast microbiota and function of core yeasts in the fermentation process of Maotai-flavor Baijiu production. [Results] Results of amplicons and metatranscriptomics showed that yeast in the fermentation process classified to 10 genera. We selected 13 core structure species (relative abundance>0.2%) of yeast microbiota and identified 2 core yeasts including Pichia kudriavzevii and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In the fermentation process, the relative abundance of P. kudriavzevii had more than 89% of the total microbes in the yeast microbiota. Meanwhile, Schi. pombe expressed more than 21% of the total functional genes in the yeast microbiota. Moreover, the results of the simulated fermentation experiments showed that P. kudriavzevii could tolerate lactic acid accumulation and Schi. pombe could tolerate ethanol accumulation in the yeast microbiota.

Firstly, the analysis of correlation between three-dimensional fluorescence spectra and liquor's year shows that the year information is mainly distributed in the area of excitation wavelength of 200-230 rim and 250-320 nm and the emission wavelength of 400-500 nm. Secondly, by analyzing the multiple correlations of two-dimensional fluorescence spectra with the excitation wavelength of 220 nm, it is found that the multiple correlation of original spectra is stronger than that under wavelet decomposition. The detail signals have weak multiple correlation, while the approximate signal has strong multiple correlation. Finally, the spectral forecast model related to the year and the statistical distribution of year information are studied based on the nonlinear partial least square regression method. The results show that a year forecast model with high accuracy can be obtained by the simulated annealing algorithm, up to 0.96 year. The original fluorescence spectra contain abundant year information. The year information of wavelet decomposition spectra has layered distribution, and the year information is mainly concentrated in the third and the fourth layer. Furthermore, by the comparison of fluorescence spectral models in above three typical excitation wavelength interval, the year forecast model with high precision can be established in the excitation wavelength of 200-230 nm. The partial least square regression algorithm can effectively eliminates the multiple correlations among the fluorescence spectra. The research results provide not only a convenient optical method for the year calibration of the liquor, but also an important reference for the fluorescence spectra research of multi-component gradient system.

Here, we studied the dynamics of these two compounds during spontaneous Chinese liquor fermentation. The two compounds reached the maximum concentration at day 10 and the maximum production rate at day 3. Metatranscriptomic analysis at days 3 and 10 revealed a total of 354 metabolically active microorganisms. Saccharomyces and Lactobacillus were identified as core microbiota critical for sulfur compound production based on both the transcript abundances of the principal genes and the distribution frequencies of 31 enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism. Saccharomyces transcribed genes encoding 23 enzymes related to the generation of 3-(methylthio)-1-propanol and dimethyl disulfide, and Lactobacillus was active in the methyl cycle, which recycles methionine, the precursor of the two sulfur compounds. Furthermore, the sulfur metabolism-related characteristics of two representative species were studied in coculture during a simulated fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae JZ109 produced 158.4 mu g/liter 3-(methylthio)-1-propanol and 58.5 mu g/liter dimethyl disulfide in monoculture, whereas Lactobacillus buchneri JZ-JN-2017 could not produce these two compounds in monoculture.

Here we proposed an absolute Raman difference spectra to quantify these spectral differences and the concentration of aqueous ethanol. The absolute Raman difference spectra are obtained through subtracting the normalized spectra of pure ethanol from the normalized spectra of solution. The intensity of the absolute Raman difference spectra related to the concentration of ethanol. Using the relationship, we measured the ethanol concentration of a series of bottled Chinese liquors. The measured values agree well with those marked on the bottle, which confirms the reliability of the absolute Raman difference spectra. Based on this method, we also measured the spectra of a series of bulk liquors in Xi'an. The results show that the ethanol concentration of bulk liquor is generally a few degrees lower than its identification value, which highlights the need for supervision of bulk liquors. Our results show significantly that the absolute Raman difference spectrum is a good method to detect the ethanol concentration of liquors rapidly.",1000-0593,,WOS:000556010000026,,

The three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum of liquor contained the information of the fluorescent substance, and its decomposition factor was related to the intensity of the characteristic peak. The decomposition of the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum by Gaussian wavelet can avoid the problem of selecting the specific excitation wavelength when decomposing the two-dimensional fluorescence spectrum. After the wavelet decomposition of the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum of the sample, the orthogonal factor model was constructed by the fourth layer approximation coefficient, and the liquor was discriminated by the factor loading. The results showed that the factors with small contribution contain unique information of the sample, which can not be neglected in the comparison of similar samples. In the classification of liquor flavor, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of the samples were decomposed by Gaussian wavelet, and the fourth-layer approximation coefficients were used for factor analysis to obtain multiple factors with large and small contribution rates. According to the factor of the factor loading, the cluster analysis was carried out. The results showed that the factor with a small contribution rate can increase the correct rate to 90%. By analyzing the correlation between the factor loading and the year of liquors, the contribution rate of the first six factors was larger than that of the liquor, and the correlation between the factors and the year of liquor was small, so the first six factor can be used to predict the year of Chinese liquors. By selecting the factors with different contribution rates to predict the year of liquor, the average error can be reduced to 0. 9 years.",1000-0593,,WOS:000443104600032,,

In this study, we efficiently improved the liquor's flavor by perturbing the intrinsic microbial metabolism with extrinsic microbes. We first constructed a basic microbial group (intrinsic) containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, and Issatchenkia orientalis and added special flavor producers (extrinsic), Saccharomyces uvarum and Saccharomyces servazzii, to this intrinsic group.

Effect of the operation conditions on the yield and quality of the liquor, and variation of liquor components during distillation were investigated. The steam flowrate of 1.60 kg/min gives the best yield and quality, suggesting there exists an optimal flowrate for the distillation. The yield and quality of the liquor drops down obviously with the increase of bulk density, implying that the fermented grains should be loosely packed. Increasing the bed height from 600 to 1250 mm enhances the yield and quality, indicating that current distiller (commonly used bed height from 700 to 900 mm) has great potential of improvement. Adding small amount of edible alcohol in the steam boiler is proven to increase the liquor yield, but excess amount causes the quality degraded sharply. The liquor-vapor leaking is found to commonly occur at the initial stage of distillation process and dramatically decrease the yield and quality. A simple method is proposed to eliminate the leaking effectively.

The type of process used to make liquor-craft or industrial-alters the operational environment and the aromatic qualities of the product contributed by various microbial consortia. But differences in microbial community assembly and temporal succession are often overlooked. In this study, we investigated bacterial community dynamics, substrate consumption, and metabolite production during both craft and industrial liquor-making processes (CLP and ILP, respectively). We found that the compositions of bacterial communities were different, even though no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed in bacterial species between CLP and ILP at the beginning of fermentation. During ILP, glucose was used more rapidly by microflora, leading in turn to a higher ethanol production rate during the early stage of fermentation. The higher rate of ethanol production in ILP shortened the lifetime of bacteria such as Weissella, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Bacillus during the early stage of fermentation. Lactobacillus sp. became dominant earlier in ILP than in CLP. Finally, the change in bacterial community dynamics led to changes in aroma compounds.

To solve this problem, we propose a novel data processing method using the bio-inspired neural network modeled on the mammalian olfactory system. Through a neural coding scheme with multiple squared cosine receptive fields, continuous sensor data are simplified as the spike pattern in virtual receptor units. The biologically plausible olfactory bulb, which mimics the structure and function of main olfactory pathways, is designed to refine the olfactory information embedded in the encoded spikes. As a simplified presentation of cortical function, the bionic olfactory cortex is established to further analyze olfactory bulb's outputs and perform classification. The proposed method can automatically learn features without tedious steps such as denoising, feature extraction and reduction, which significantly simplifies the processing procedure for e-noses. To validate algorithm performance, comparison studies were performed for seven kinds of Chinese liquors using the proposed method and traditional data processing methods. The experimental results show that squared cosine receptive fields and the olfactory bulb model are crucial for improving classification performance, and the proposed method has higher classification rates than traditional methods when the sensor quantity and type are changed.

Daqu is a mixture of two components: milled wheat and a complex microbial community. The composition and the effects of this microbial group are largely unknown. In this study, we have analysed the constituents of the microbial community and the development of microorganisms in the industrial Daqu preparation and ripening process. More than 200 colonies were isolated and characterized. The isolates were discriminated by phenotypic and conventional biochemical taxonomic methods. The results revealed the presence of bacteria, moulds and yeasts. Bacteria consist of Bacillus, Acetobacter, Lactobacillus, and Clostridium, among which Bacillus strains were found to be predominant. Moulds consisted of Aspergillus, Mucor, Rhizopus, Monascus and Trichoderma, and Aspergillus strains were found to be predominant in the six different biotypes. Yeasts comprised Saccharomyces, Hansenula, Candida, Pichia, and Torulaspora. The most frequently isolated yeasts belonged to the genus Saccharomyces. The microbial diversity shift showed that the microbial genera changed with increasing ripening time.

The metabolic activity of each species in mixed and inoculated fermentations of liquor was investigated in 14 different cocultures that used different combinations of these species.

Microbes in the pit mud produce key precursors of flavor esters. The maturation time of natural pit mud of over 20 years has promoted attempts to produce artificial pit mud (APM) with a shorter maturation time. However, knowledge about the molecular basis of APM microbial dynamics and associated functional variation during SFB brewing is limited, and the role of this variability in high-quality SFB production remains poorly understood. We studied APM maturation in new cellars until the fourth brewing batch using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, quantitative PCR, metaproteomics, and metabolomics techniques. A total of 36 prokaryotic classes and 195 genera were detected. Bacilli and Clostridia dominated consistently, and the relative abundance of Bacilli decreased along with the APM maturation. Even though both amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR showed increased abundance of Clostridia, the levels of most of the Clostridium proteins were similar in both the first- and fourth-batch APM samples. Six genera correlated with eight or more major flavor compounds in SFB samples. Functional prediction suggested that the prokaryotic communities in the fourth-batch APM samples were actively engaged in organic acid metabolism, and the detected higher concentrations of proteins and metabolites in the corresponding metabolic pathways supported the prediction. This multi-omics approach captured changes in the abundances of specific microbial species, proteins, and metabolites during APM maturation, which are of great significance for the optimization of APM culture technique.IMPORTANCE Strong-flavor baijiu (SFB) accounts for more than 70% of all Chinese liquor production. In the Chinese baijiu brewing industry, artificial pit mud (APM) has been widely used since the 1960s to construct fermentation cellars for production of high-quality SFB. To gain insights at the systems level into the mechanisms driving APM prokaryotic taxonomic and functional dynamics and into how this variation is connected with high-quality SFB production, we performed the first combined metagenomic, metaproteomic, and metabolomic analyses of this brewing microecosystem. Together, the multi-omics approach enabled us to develop a more complete picture of the changing metabolic processes occurring in APM microbial communities during high-quality SFB production, which will be helpful for further optimization of APM culture technique and improvement of SFB quality.",2379-5077,,WOS:000531077500024,32209718,

Jiupei (low pH, high ethanol) and pit mud (neutral pH) provided two habitats with distinctly different environmental conditions for microbial growth. Lactic acid accumulated in jiupei, while butyric and hexanoic acids were mainly produced by microbes inhabiting the pit mud. Biomass analysis using quantitative real-time PCR showed that bacteria dominated the microbial consortia during fermentation, moreover cluster and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) analysis showed that the bacterial communities of jiupei and pit mud were significantly divergent. The bacterial community diversity of jiupei decreased significantly during the fermentation process, and was relatively stable in pit mud. Lactobacillus dominated the jiupei bacterial community, and its relative abundance reached 98.0% at the end of fermentation.

The traditional mud cellar fermentation method is unsuitable for mechanized operation and thus laborintensive, and the original Baijiu often has the smell of pit mud. In order to produce Luzhou-flavor Baijiu without cellar mud,the fermentation broth of caproic acid was produced by cultivating pit mud microorganisms separately,and then mixed with fermented grains. The preparation of caproic acid fermentation broth was prepared by liquid anaerobic culture,and after 9 d fermentation,the content of caproic acid reached about 10 g /L and the content of butyric acid 2 g /L. Fermented grains were prepared in so-called pre-fermentation,which is traditional solid-state fermentation with a duration of 6 - 8 d according to physical and chemical parameters such as the content of alcohol and residual starch. Then a post-fermentation was conducted by mixing 0.04 g caproic acid fermentation broth with 100 g pre-fermented grains,till the total fermentation period was 42 d.

Hence, the flavour formation mechanism of Baijiu aging was investigated using electrochemistry and UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS/MS, which enabled us to solve the two difficulties above. The oxidation reaction on gold surface could accelerate Baijiu aging by catalyzing the transformation from alcohols to acids. Although natural aging contributed more diverse compound changes to Baijiu, the oxygen-based oxidation process during natural aging was similar to that in the electrochemical oxidation as a whole.

A quartz piezoelectric crystal here serves as the basal material and nonmetallic polymer thin films with perforative central holes as the surface coating according to the principle of quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), based on the Kirchhoff-Love plate model. A mechanical model of the new sensor was built, and its structure was a quartz piezoelectric sandwich composite circular plate with perforative central holes in the surface layers. The form of the electric potential field in the piezoelectric layer was here assumed to be such that the Maxwell static electricity equation is satisfied. The validation of the mechanical model and its analytic method is conducted by comparing the free vibration frequencies of the piezoelectric sandwich composite circular plate produced by the mechanical model's analytical and numerical analyses performed using ANSYS software. Results show that the first 100 orders of free vibration frequency values of the mechanical model obtained by two methods, the analytical analysis and the numerical analysis, to be fit.

Two methods were used, a culture-dependent method (viable cell counting) and a culture-independent method (high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer region). It was found that thermotolerant microorganisms such as Bacillus, Thermomyces and Actinobacteria were dominant in all stages of Daqu fermentation, especially during the high-temperature period of days 7-38. In the initial 110 days of fermentation, operational taxonomic units and number of bacteria were higher than those of fungi, but the opposite was observed towards the end of fermentation (day 140). In mature Daqu, the predominant bacterial species were Bacillus and unclassified Thermoactinomycetaceae, followed by Thermoactinomyces, Kroppenstedtia and Saccharopolyspora; the predominant fungi were Aspergillus, unclassified Trichocomaceae, Thermomyces, Rhizopus, Monascus and Candida, among others.

Considering the small sample size in e-noses, we design a small scale convolutional neural network model, which is capable of extracting useful features automatically rather than manually.

A particular concern is how to maintain the microbial consortia in mixed cultures to achieve stable MCFA production. The Chinese strong aroma-type liquor (Baijiu) fermentation system continually produces caproic acid for decades through a spontaneous inoculation of anaerobes from pit mud into fermented grains. Therefore, illuminating the dominant caproate-producing bacterium (CPB) in pit mud and how the CPB is sustained in the spontaneous fermentation system will help to reveal the microbiological mechanisms of stable caproate production. Here, we examined pit mud samples across four Chinese strong aroma-type Baijiu-producing areas and found that a caproate-producing Caproicibacterium sp. was widely distributed in these distilleries, with relative abundance ranging from 1.4 to 355% and an average abundance of 11.4%. Through controlling carbon source availability, we obtained different simplified caproate-producing consortia and found that the growth advantage of Caproicibacterium sp. was highly dependent on glucose. Then, two strains, named Caproicibacterium sp. strain LBM19010 and Caproicibacterium sp. strain JNU-WLY1368, were isolated from pit mud of two regions. The metabolic versatility of this species utilizing starch, maltose, glucose, and lactate reflected its adaptability to the fermentation environment where these carbon sources coexist. The simultaneous utilization of glucose and lactate contributed to the balance between cell growth and pH homeostasis.

Although several studies have revealed the correlation between microbial community composition and abiotic factors, the adaptation mechanisms of dominant species to abiotic environment are still unknown in this special anaerobic habitat. This study identified the predominant CPB in Chinese strong aroma-type Baijiu fermentation system.

The resulting volatile datasets were analyzed by partial least-squares discriminant analysis, Spearman's correlation and Random-forest decision-tree, to identify potential age-markers. The contents of long chain fatty acid ethyl esters varied the most during maturation, mostly being absent in freshly-distilled Baijiu, but appearing at different times. Similar behavior was observed in bottled samples matured up to four years. In addition, a slight increase in short/medium chain fatty acid ester content was observed. Unsupervised PCA analysis, applied only to the fatty acid ethyl ester dataset, was able to distinguish between bottled Baijiu samples matured for one, two, three, or four years. These age-markers may help establish a reliable model for verifying the maturation time of Lu-flavor Baijiu.

To identify the key flavor producers in Chinese liquor fermentation, we propose a novel quantitative microbiome profiling method that uses indigenous internal standards to normalize high-throughput amplicon sequencing results. We screened Lactobacillus acetotolerans and Lactobacillus jinshani as indigenous internal standards based on their high distribution frequencies and relative abundances. After determining the absolute abundance of indigenous internal standards using quantitative PCR with species-specific primers, the liquorfermented bacterial community and its dynamics were better characterized by internal standards normalization. Based on quantitative microbiome profiling, we identified that Lactobacillus was a key flavor producer correlated with eight flavor compounds. Metatranscriptomic analysis indicated that Lactobacillus was active in transcribing genes involving the biosynthesis of flavor compounds and their precursors. This work has developed a novel and extensible absolute quantification method for microbiota that will alleviate concerns in the statistical analyses based on relative microbiome profiling, and shed insights into the function of Lactobacillus in food fermentation. It can potentially be applied to other microbial ecology studies.IMPORTANCE In this study, we developed a novel strategy using indigenous internal standards to normalize the high-throughput amplicon sequencing results.

Eight mixed samples were sampled from the wall and bottom layers of the pit mud in the cellars. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was employed to analyse actinobacteria community structure and diversity from the samples.For the analysis, 16S rRNA fragments about 400 bp amplified from DNA extracted from the eight mixed pit mud samples. Among all samples, ten stronger bands and few number of less intense bands were detected, only three stronger bands can be amplified from each sample, differences between the DGGE patterns of the different position of pit mud were also detected. On the whole, however, the community of the samples taken from the same position was comparatively similar, and a regular pattern was observed during the community succession. In the same cellar, except the sample used for about 1 year, the diversity index (H) of the wall-layer sample was much higher than the bottom - layer samples', while the evenness index (EH) is opposite. In addition, with the increase of pit age, the H values of the wall-layer sample gradually increased from 1.74 to 2.28, and decreased from 2.07 to 1.73 in the bottom-layer sample. Meanwhile all samples showed a linear trend toward decrease in the EH values, and the variation of EH values of the wall and the bottom layers were between 0.986 to 0.991 and 0.971 to 0.994, respectively. Moreover, the similarity coefficient (S_c) between the bottom layer enhanced with the increasing pit age, ranging from 0.46 to 0.82, and the S_c values of the bottom layer ranged from 0.31 to 0.62. The recovery of DGGE strip series showed the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the ten stronger bands and the typical strains published in Genbank was 90% to 100%, and those sequences belonged to four genera (Olsenella, Atopobium, Streptomyces and Corynebacterium). The three stronger bands that can be amplified from each sample belonged to Olsenella and Atopobium. With the increasing pit age,the dominant degree (d_i) of the three stronger bands in the wall-layer generally decreased, but increased in the bottom-layer. This result revealed the abundant diversity of actinobacteria in the pit mud of Chinese Luzhou-flavour liquor.

The composition and changes in the microbial community during the making of Daqu have a significant impact on the quality of Daqu liquor. In this study, microbial diversity based on high throughput sequencing technology was used to reveal the bacterial community structure and succession law in the four critical stages of high temperature Daqu production. The results show that Firmicutes had a significant advantage (76.7%-98.2%) in the four stages as Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria reached peak values in the first and second periods, and decreased in the later periods. At the genus level, Kroppenstedtia, Lactobacillus, Weissella, Lentibacillus, Bacillus and Saccharopolyspora were detected as the main bacterial groups in the high temperature Daqu of Chinese sesame flavour liquor. The abundance of Lactobacillus and Weissella was greater than that of other microbes in the Daqu entry period. During the first Daqu flipping, the number of bacterial genera reached a peak in the production process.

To improve the flavor character of Daqu, we inoculated Bacillus licheniformis and studied the effect of this strain on the community structure and metabolic profile in Daqu fermentation. The microbial relative abundance changed after the inoculation, including the increase in Bacillus, Clavispora and Aspergillus, and the decrease in Pichia, Saccharomycopsis and some other genera. This variation was also confirmed by pure culture and coculture experiments. Seventy-three metabolites were identified during Daqu fermentation process. After inoculation, the average content of aromatic compounds were significantly enriched from 0.37 mg/kg to 0.90 mg/kg, and the average content of pyrazines significantly increased from 035 mg/kg to 5.71 mg/kg. The increase in pyrazines was positively associated with the metabolism of the inoculated Bacillus and the native genus Clavispora, because they produced much more pyrazines in their cocultures. Whereas the increase in aromatic compounds might be related to the change of in situ metabolic activity of several native genera, in particular, Aspergillus produced more aromatic compounds in cocultures with B. licheniformis. It indicated that the inoculation of B. licheniformis altered the flavor character of Daqu by both its own metabolic activity and the variation of in situ metabolic activity. Moreover, B. licheniformis inoculation influenced the enzyme activity of Daqu, including the significant increase in amylase activity (from 13 g starch/g/h to 1.7 g starch/g/h), and the significant decrease in glucoamylase activity (from 627.6 mg glucose/g/h to 445.6 mg glucose/g/h) and esterase activity (from 28.1 mg ethyl caproate/g/100 h to 17.2 mg ethyl caproate/g/100 h).

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of Huangshui esterification by whole-cell enzymes produced from different microbial strains. Esterification of Huangshui was carried out for 16days via the addition of different preparations produced from Rhizopus chinensis strain 3.1149, Rhizopus chinensis strain 3.1166, Monascus purpureus SICC 3.19 and Rhizopus oryzae SICC 3.623. The results showed that the preparation GP1, produced from M. purpureus, exhibited the highest esterification efficiency compared with the other preparations based on physicochemical analysis in combination with volatile profile analysis. In addition, a characterization of preparation GP1 was performed and the optimal alcohol content and pH for esterification were 10% and pH3.5, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the total ester content increased from 4.86 to 7.31g/L after esterification for 16days. An estimation of the sensory impact of the volatile compounds after esterification was performed by a calculation of the odour active values (OAVs). Radar diagrams of the OAVs demonstrated the differences in the sensory profiles in Huangshui, before and after esterification. Nearly all of the OAVs of the esters were increased by the esterification reaction and were above the human sensory threshold. Results presented in this manuscript provide a potential strategy for the efficient bio-conversion of Huangshui.

Microbes in pit mud play key roles in the fermentation cellar for the CSFL production. However, microbial diversity, community structure, and cellar-age-related changes in pit mud are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prokaryotic community structure and diversity in pit-mud samples with different cellar ages (1, 10, 25, and 50 years) using the pyrosequencing technique. Results indicated that prokaryotic diversity increased with cellar age until the age reached 25 years and that prokaryotic community structure changed significantly between three cellar ages (1, 10, and 25 years). Significant correlations between prokaryotic communities and environmental variables (pH, NH4+, lactic acid, butyric acid, and caproic acid) were observed. Overall, our study results suggested that the long-term brewing operation shapes unique prokaryotic community structure and diversity as well as pit-mud chemistry. We have proposed a three-phase model to characterize the changes of pit-mud prokaryotic communities. (i) Phase I is an initial domestication period. Pit mud is characterized by abundant Lactobacillus and high lactic acid and low pH levels. (ii) Phase II is a transition period. While Lactobacillus abundance decreases dramatically, that of Bacteroidetes and methanogens increases. (iii) Phase III is a relative mature period. The prokaryotic community shows the highest diversity and capability to produce more caproic acid as a precursor for synthesis of ethyl caproate, the main flavor component in CSFL.

Filamentous fungi produce many enzymes to degrade the starch material into fermentable sugar during liquor fermentation. This study investigated the filamentous fungal community associated with liquor making process. Eight and seven different fungal species were identified by using culture-dependent and -independent method (PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, DGGE) analyses, respectively. The traditional enumeration method showed that Daqu provided 7 fungal species for stacking fermentation. The total population of filamentous fungi increased from 3.4 x 10(3) cfu/g to 1.28 x 10(4) cfu/g in the first 3 days of stacking fermentation, and then decreased till the end. In alcohol fermentation in pits, the population continuously decreased and few fungal species survived (lower than 1 x 10(3) cfu/g) after 10 days. Therefore, stacking fermentation is an essential stage for the growth of filamentous fungi. Paecilomyces variotii, Aspergillus myzae and Aspergillus tetreus were detected by both methods, and P. variotii and A. oryzae were the predominant species. Meanwhile, P. variotii possessed the highest glucoamylase (3252 +/- 526 U/g) and A. oryzae exhibited the highest a-amylase (1491 +/- 324 U/g) activity among the cultivable fungal species. Furthermore, the variation of starch and reducing sugar content was consistent with the growth of P. variotii and A. oryzae in Zaopei (fermented grains) during stacking fermentation, which implied that the two filamentous fungi played an important role in producing amylase for hydrolyzing the starch.

In this study, a nationwide investigation was conducted in China to evaluate the characteristics of bauxite liquor in Chinese impoundments, and to evaluate the suitability of GCLs containing granular sodium bentonite or BPCs for containment. Hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted on six BPC GCLs with two characteristic Chinese bauxite liquors that are hyperalkaline (pH > 12) and had ionic strengths of 76.9 mM and 620.3 mM. The BPC GCLs had hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10(-8)-10(-12) m/s, which is higher than the hydraulic conductivity of BPC GCLs to deionized water (10(-12)-10(-13) m/s), but lower than the hydraulic conductivity of conventional GCLs with granular sodium bentonite GCLs to the same liquors (10(-7)-10(-8) m/s). The hydraulic conductivity of the BPC GCLs depends on the chemical properties of the leachate, the polymer loading, and the type of polymer.

In this study, the influence factors involved in EC determination were investigated using Chinese liquor as sample matrix, and the improved method was further applied. Three types of SPE columns, including diatomite, Florisil, and primary-secondary amine, were compared in extraction efficiency, and the diatomite column exhibited the highest extraction efficiency. The optimal volumes of elution solvents with diatomite column were 15 mL for 3-mL samples solution loaded.

Especially, age liquor is facing the crisis of confidence because it is difficult for consumer to identify the marked age, which prompts unscrupulous traders to pose off low-grade liquors as high-grade liquors. An ideal method for authenticity confirmation of liquors should be non-invasive, non-destructive and timely. The combination of near-infrared spectroscopy with chemometrics proves to be a good way to reach these premises. A new strategy is proposed for classification and verification of the adulteration of liquors by using NIR spectroscopy and chemometric classification, i.e., ensemble support vector machines (SVM). Three measures, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were used for performance evaluation. The results confirmed that the strategy can serve as a screening tool applied to verify adulteration of the liquor, that is, a prior step used to condition the sample to a deeper analysis only when a positive result for adulteration is obtained by the proposed methodology.

However, APM frequently ages during fermentation, thus becoming unsuitable for sustainable use due to its low-quality. The reasons behind, and results of, APM aging during the production of CSFL are not yet understood. Sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene shows that prokaryotic diversity is significantly decreased (Shannon's diversity index, P < 0.01) and community composition is distinctly changed (from 1197 to 865 OTUs) in aging APM. On the phylum level, the increase of Firmicutes and decrease of Proteobacteria are the main consequences of APM aging during the production of CSFL. The counting of cultivatable bacteria confirmed that there was a large increase in Lactobacilli and aerobic spore-forming bacteria in aging low-quality APM (more than twofold). Unexpectedly, the total number of caproic acid-producing bacteria, mainly Clostridia, did not change significantly between the two kinds of APM. Furthermore, biochemical analysis indicates that the pH and the levels of NH4+ and K+ are decreased in aging lowquality APM (P < 0.01). The results obtained in this study support the possibility that environmental factors (pH, nutrients) induce the decrease of prokaryotic diversity, and the changed community composition influences the environmental properties. Therefore, through interfering with the cycle, APM aging can be controlled potentially by adjustment of environmental factors and/or supplementation of diminished or missed microorganisms.",2190-572X,2190-5738,WOS:000411041000001,28955632,

The succession of incubation temperature, a main operating parameter, and microbial composition in Daqu were investigated during the manufacturing process. The most significant difference in temperature occurred during the middle stage at which the highest and the lowest temperatures were detected in Houhuo (HH) and Qingcha (QC), respectively. It was shown that for the counting data, the population of fungi was identical and that of bacteria was different between three types of Daqu. According to analysis results of microbial community structure using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), lactic acid bacteria were one of the dominant bacterial groups in all of Daqu and fungal diversity in QC was higher than that in HH and Hongxin (HX). The difference in incubation temperature led to the accumulation of different heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive fungi in the completed Daqu. PCA of DGGE profiles revealed that microbial community structure was distinct between three types of Daqu. It was presumed that temperature might play a decisive role in the formation of micro-organism composition in starter cultures.Significance and Impact of the StudyThe usage of a combination of three types of Daqu including Qingcha, Hongxin and Houhuo as starter culture is an important characteristic of production technology of Chinese light aroma style liquor. Micro-organisms from the environment naturally inoculated in Daqu are propagated to form the special microbial community under the control of several operating parameters, especially temperature, and finally play various roles in the fermentation process of liquor.

Herein, the Roche 454 pyrosequencing technique and a phospholipid fatty-acid analysis were employed to reveal the structure and diversity of prokaryotic communities in FPM samples that have been aged for 5, 30, and 100 years. The results revealed an increase in total prokaryotic biomass with an FP age; however, Shannon's diversity index decreased significantly (p <0.01).

Although the importance of environmental microbiota has been highlighted, the ecological processes that how the environmental microbiota affects the fermentation microbial community are poorly understood. To study the effect of the environmental microbiota on community assembly, the sources of microbiota and the ecological processes of the fermentation were characterized in sauce-flavor Baijiu. Results showed that the process of sauce-flavor Baijiu making could be divided into three phases according to fermentation parameters. Heap fermentation (phase I) was an important period for rapid temperature rise, substrate utilization and production accumulation. The microbial community of heap fermentation was characterized by decrease of diversity and rapid succession of community structure. Virgibacillus, Kroppenstedtia, Bacillus and Oceanobacillus were predominant in the initial heap fermentation, while Lactobacillus was predominant during the later stage. Pichia was the predominant fungal genus during the whole fermentation process. Then, SourceTracker results showed that Daqu provided 95.6% of the bacterial community and 28.10% of the fungal community to heap fermentation, whereas the environments (indoor ground and tools) provided 71.9% of the fungal communities (mainly Pichia) to heap fermentation. Next, the results revealed that the temperature, ethanol and microbial interaction of Pichia synergistically drove the dynamic of the microbial community during the heap fermentation process. Pichia was proved to be the heat-resistant fungi and strong competitor based on growth in different temperature and competition assays in vitro. Finally, the quick succession of heap fermentation microbiota increased the enrichment of volatile flavors such as acids and esters.

Here, using Chinese liquor fermentation as a model system containing a low microbial diversity, we studied temporal changes in microbial community structure and functioning. For that, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the composition of bacteria and fungi and analyzed the microbially derived metabolome throughout the fermentation process in all four seasons in both 2018 and 2019. We show that microbial communities and the metabolome changed throughout the fermentation process in each of the four seasons, with metabolome diversity increasing throughout the fermentation process. Across seasons, bacterial and fungal communities as well as the metabolome driven by 10 indicator microorganisms and six metabolites varied even more. Daily average temperature in the external surroundings was the primary determinant of the observed temporal microbial community and metabolome changes. Collectively, our work reveals critical insights into patterns and processes determining temporal changes of microbial community composition and functioning. We highlight the importance of linking taxonomic to functional changes in microbial ecology to enable predictions of human-relevant applications.IMPORTANCE We used Chinese liquor fermentation as a model system to show that microbiome composition changes more dramatically across seasons than throughout the fermentation process within seasons. These changes translate to differences in the metabolome as the ultimate functional outcome of microbial activity, suggesting that temporal changes in microbiome composition are translating into functional changes. This result is striking as it suggests that microbial functioning, despite controlled conditions in the fermentors, fluctuates over season along with external temperature differences, which threatens a reproducible food taste. As such, we believe that our study provides a stepping-stone into novel taxonomy-functional studies that promote future work in other systems and that also is relevant in applied settings to better control surrounding conditions in food production.",2379-5077,,WOS:000572105700045,32694129,

Daqu is the undefined starter used for Chinese liquor, which contributed many fermentation functional fungal and bacterial communities to liquor fermentation process. However, the sources of these microbial communities and how these microorganisms formed in Daqu are still unclear. In this study, high-throughput sequencing combined with microbial source tracking analysis were applied to analyze the sources of the microbial communities in Daqu. We found fungal communities in Daqu were mainly originated from Daqu making environments (mainly tools and indoor ground), including Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Pichia kudriavzevii, Rhizopus oryzae, Sterigmatomyces elviae, Aspergillus fiavus/oryzae, Hyphopichia burtonii and Lichtheimia corymbifera. Meanwhile, most of bacterial communities in Daqu were from raw materials, including Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacilli. During Daqu-making process, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria that were not beneficial to liquor fermentation declined, but the abundance of the fermentation functional yeasts and Bacilli increased. Moreover, network analysis showed the bacteria in Daqu might be the drivers for the microbial succession during the Daqu-making process.

In this work, a total of 16 pyrazines were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) in SSAB. The quantitative results showed that 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine and 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine were the three most concentrated pyrazines. The highest odor activity value (OAV) was determined for 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine. Quantitative analysis combined with descriptive sensory analysis revealed that sub-threshold pyrazines (2,3-dimethylpyrazine, 2,3-diethylpyrazine, 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine and 2-acetyl-3-methylpyrazine) are significantly correlated with the roasted aroma in SSAB. Our study focused on the impact of sub-threshold pyrazines on the perception of roasted aroma in SSAB. The effect of the sub-threshold pyrazines was detected by the addition of various pyrazines in SSAB samples, despite their sub-threshold concentrations. Furthermore, the presence of sub-threshold pyrazines in dilute alcohol solution resulted in a significant reduction in the odor thresholds of supra-threshold pyrazines.

First, through principal component analysis (PCA), backward cloud generator and forward cloud generator, two-dimensional cloud droplet groups of different flavor information were established by using liquor taste data collected by electronic tongue. Second, the frequency and order of the evaluation words for different flavor of liquor were obtained by counting and analyzing the data appeared in the artificial sensory evaluation experiment.

We demonstrated that Moutai treatment induced hepatic stellate cell (HSC) apoptosis and suppressed collagen deposition, as well as attenuated hepatic fibrosis. The antifibrosis mechanism of Moutai was possibly related with the inhibition of Kupffer cell and HSC activation via suppressing NF kappa B nuclear translocation and preventing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

To investigate the connection between MTFS and the Bacillus subtilis (one of dominant bacteria in MTDQ) cultured on solid plates of wheat extract medium at, temperatures of 37, 46, and up to 55 degrees C (Group A), and at a constant 37 degrees C (Group B), the transcriptomes of the bacteria grown in the two groups were studied. About 10 out of 84 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were related to promoting sporulation. Furthermore, observations made with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that a thicker spore cortex appeared in Group A. The content of 2, 6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA), an important component of the spore, was 49.77 (+/- 2.50) and 38.23 (+/- 3.96) mu g/mg of dried spores from the bacteria cultured in Groups A and B, respectively. Combined with the production process of Maotai liquor, more DPA accumulates in the high-temperature fermentation stage and is then released by spore germination during the subsequent temperature-drop stage. We suggest that DPA (or its derivatives) can then be transformed into MTFS by the Maillard reaction after many rounds of microbial fermentation.

It was found that an optimal steam flowrate exists in the sight of enhancing liquor yield and quality. The lower steam flowrate can not provide the thermal condition for full evaporation of ethanol, while the higher steam flowrate causes the fermented grains to be pasted and increases the diffusion resistance. The yield and quality drop down with the increase of bed density, it indicates that the loosely packed grain bed is recommended.When the bed height increases from 600 to 1250 mm, the yield and quality are gradually enhanced. It implies that the great potential exists for the improvement of current distillation equipments(their bed height is only 700~900 mm).Adding small amount of edible alcohol to the steam boiler(cross-steaming technique)is helpful to increase the yield, but excess addition leads to degrade the quality sharply.The liquor-vapor leaking observably brings down both the yield and quality, and this phenomenon is attributed to the temporal pressure rise caused by the trapped air in the distillation system. The gas chromatography analysis result shows that the variations of flavor compounds during the distillation process are closely related to their dissolving properties in ethanol. The findings provide valuable guidance for the improvements of distillation process and equipment for the strong-fragrance type liquid production.",1003-9015,,CSCD:4343457,,

High-throughput sequencing (HIS) combined with isolation and identification of microorganisms were used to investigate the microbial community dynamics during the brewing process. The traditional xiaoqu group displayed higher acidity than pure culture xiaoqu group from day 9 to day 15. During the continuous brewing process, Bacillus, Lactobacillius and Lactococcus were the dominant bacteria. Bacillus exhibited higher abundance than lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from day 0 to day 6, then LAB exhibited higher abundance than Bacillus from day 9 to day 15. Lactococcus was the predominant LAB from day 0 to day 6 then Lactobacillius dominated and Lactococcus remained stable but with low abundance from day 9 to day 15.

Here, the above topics on FGs in the actual production process were comprehensively studied by using a combination of physicochemical analysis, GC-MS detection and Illumina HiSeq sequencing methods. The whole fermentation process could be divided into two stages including early (0-25d) and the later stage (25-60d) based on the dynamics of FG physicochemical properties and the changes of prokaryotic community diversity. A total of 41phyla and 364 genera were detected, and 9 of them were dominant genera in FG complex ecosystem, including Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Ochrobactrum, Bacillus etc. Among them, the dynamics of 29 top10 genera in FGs were mainly influenced by the starch and total acid, followed by NH4+ and ethanol, and 7 genera (hubs, e.g., Clostridium, Methanosaeta, Bacillus, etc.) of them may play important roles in FG ecosystem stability. A total of 71 volatiles including 33 esters, 14 alcohols, 9 fatty acids, 5 phenols, and 10 other compounds were detected in the FGs, and most of them formed in the early stage. Some important flavor substances (e.g., ethyl octanoate, 3-methylbutanol, hexanoate, etc.) increased in the later stage. Moreover, the formation of some flavor compound might require multiple microbes involved. For instance, ten of the top10 genera, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Methanosarcina, Sedimentibacter, Bacillus, etc., were significantly and positively correlated with four important esters.

To imitate the traditional aging course of Fenjiu, oxygen was introduced into the reactor, and ceramic material was coated on the packing of RPB. Sensory evaluation results demonstrated various effects on the spirit quality under different conditions. To determine the optimum condition, experiments were performed using an orthogonal analysis of parameters in a three-factor and five-level test. The optimum experimental condition was found to be at a spirit flow rate of 80 L/h, with a spirit temperature of 45 degrees C and a gas flow rate of 900 L/h. Under this optimal condition, the treated spirit obtained a taste equivalent to that of a spirit conventionally aged for 2 years. Comparisons of gas chromatography measurements, metal content, and electric conductivity were made between treated and untreated samples. Results show that the RPB treatment aged Fenjiu much faster than did conventional aging, with a similar quality.

Meanwhile, we measured the concentration of some fermentation products in pit mud such as acetate, lactate, butyric acid and caproic acid, to investigate the relationship between these microbes and the fermentation products. The results showed that with the increase of cellar age, the copies of Archaea increased slightly but insignificantly, the number of total bacteria kept stable; Lachnospiraceae increased obviously from 2.4*10~(10) to 3.87*10~(12); Ruminococcaceae increased from 2.38*10~(11) to 5.37*10~(11).

Firstly, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of seven different brands liquor were measured by the FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer which produced by Edinburgh in England. The spectral shows that different bands liquors have similar fluorescence characteristics and it's difficult to distinguish them only with Fluorescent characteristic parameters. Because of this, the first-order and second-order partial derivatives respect to fluorescence emission wavelength on each of the excitation wavelength were carried out in this paper. Daubechies-7 (db7) orthonormal wavelet with compact support was used to compress the spectral data. The forth approximate coefficients were finally chosen as the new data matrix. Then the new data matrix was analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and the principal components were extracted to be used as the inputs of support vector machine (SVM). The K-fold cross validation was applied to optimize the parameters c and gamma and the prediction model was constructed in the end. Fourteen samples were selected randomly from each brand that in total of ninety-eight samples were selected as the training set, and the rest forty-two samples were collected as the prediction set. The effect of three different spectral data after processing on the model is compared: original data, the first-order and second-order partial derivatives on the spectral data.

Here, the effects of daqu microbiota on baijiu fermentation were investigated under both field-scale and lab-scale conditions. In field-scale baijiu fermentation, the dominant daqu microbes (average relative abundance 10.0%), including unclassified_Leuconostocaceae, Thermoascus, and Thermomyces, tended to dominate the early stage (0?7 d). However, the rare daqu microbes (average relative abundance <0.1%, e.g., Kazachstania) tended to dominate the middle and late stages (11?40 d). In addition, some genera showed differences in species diversity between daqu and fermented grains. The average relative abundance of Lactobacillus was over 75% during baijiu fermentation, and most of them were affiliated with Lactobacillus acetotolerans, while Lactobacillus crustorum dominated the Lactobacillus OTUs in daqu. The similar patterns were also observed during lab-scale baijiu fermentation.

Microbial structure and succession significantly affect the yield and quality of fermentation productions. Although the importance of microbial structure was extensively studied, the significance of microbial succession rate remains unclear in solid-state fermentation. To address this gap, we designed an in situ experiment in a typical distillery to characterize the effects of microbial succession rate. In this study, we found the process of strong-aroma Baijiu making could be divided into two stages according to fermentation parameters (starch, moisture, acidity, reducing sugar, alcohol, temperature). The early stage showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher microbial diversity than that of the later stage according to Shannon index. Compared with single cereal fermentation, mixed cereals fermentation showed slower microbial succession rate of stage shift. We found that Lactobacillus could reflect microbial succession rate of stage shift in strong-aroma Baijiu fermentation. Meanwhile, we found fermentation parameters could affect microbial succession rate of stage shift. Microbial diversity was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with fermentation parameters. Moreover, molecular ecological network analysis (MENA) showed that succession rate of microbial community could affect microbial interactions. In addition, fermentation of mix cereals (sorghum, wheat, corn, rice and glutinous rice) increased the enrichment of Clostridiales from pit mud according to results of source tracking. Collectively, succession rate of microbial community could be an important trait to explain differences of microbial diversity and flavor profile from the perspective of microbial decline and enrichment.

Most of these strains were characterized as toxoflavin-producing Burkholderia spp. by 16S rRNA sequencing, toxA gene-specific PCR and toxoflavin detection. The PCR assays revealed the existence of Burkholderia in the Daqu samples. The toxoflavin content in a number of Daqu samples was determined using HPLC. The highest observed content of toxoflavin in the Daqu was >8mg/kg, close to its LD50. Although no toxoflavin was detected in the distilled liquor, the safety problem regarding the use of rice straws in Daqu preparation is still noteworthy, since Burkholderia and toxoflavin can be transferred and can accumulate during the brewing process. The results can contribute to a further assessment of the contamination risk in liquor brewing caused by Burkholderia and to safer production in this traditional process.

In this investigation, based on metatranscriptomics, fungi, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium, were identified as the most active microbial members and 230 carbohydrate-active enzymes were identified as potential saccharifying enzymes at 70 degrees C of JF daqu. Notably, most of enzymes in identified carbohydrate and energy pathways showed lower expression levels at 70 degrees C of JF daqu than those at the high temperature stage (62 degrees C) of Nong-flavor (NF) daqu, indicating lowering capacities of saccharification and fermentation by high temperature stage. Moreover, many enzymes, especially those related to the degradation of aromatic compounds, were only detected with low expression levels at 70 degrees C of JF daqu albeit not at 62 degrees C of NF daqu, indicating enhancing capacities of generating special trace aroma compounds in JF daqu by high temperature stage. Additionally, most of enzymes related to those capacities were highly expressed at 70 degrees C by fungal genus of Aspergillus, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Penicillium, and Rasamsonia.

The results showed that the rule and tendency about change of fungi numbers were basically consistent respectively in upper, middle and lower fermented grains. At its initial stage, the numbers of moulds fell sharply and then momently increased on 7th day. The moulds numbers again reduced in later period until the end.

Repeatability of compound groups for the conventional and reversed column setups was compared; moreover, multiblock orthogonal component analysis (MOCA) was used to visualize data sets. OPLS-DA was used for Baijiu classification. Both column setups provided excellent discrimination of the Light, Soy sauce, Feng and Herbal aromas. A better classification result for the Strong and Jian aromas was recorded for the conventional column setup. Within the Strong aroma using OPLS-DA both column setups provided perfect abilities to discriminate Baijiu from the Sichuan, Heilongjiang and Jiangsu regions. Two validation methods were applied in the classification models - all the predictive abilities evaluated by the internal validation were further confirmed by the external validation.

The impact of VOCs on microbial community succession of fermentation is not well understood. In this study, Pichia spp. were evaluated for VOC production as a part of antifungal activity during baijiu fermentation. The results showed that the abundance of Pichia in the defect group (agglomerated fermented grains) was lower than that in control group, and a negative interaction between Pichia and Monascus was determined (P < 0.05). In addition, the disruption of fungi was significantly related to the differences of metabolic profiles in fermented grains. To determine production of VOCs from Pichia and its effect on Monascus purpureus, a double-dish system was assessed, and the incidence of M. purpureus reduction was 39.22% after 7 days. As to antifungal volatile compounds, 2-phenylethanol was identified to have an antifungal effect on M. purpureus through contact and noncontact. To further confirm the antifungal activity of 2-phenylethanol, scanning electron microscopy showed that 2-phenylethanol widely and significantly inhibited conidium germination and mycelia! growth of filamentous fungi. Metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that the Ehrlich pathway is the metabolic path of 2-phenylethanol in Pichia and identified potential antifungal mechanisms, including protein synthesis and DNA damage. This study demonstrated the role of volatile compound-mediated microbial interaction in microbiome assembly and discovered a plausible scenario in which Pichia antagonized fungal blooms. The results may improve the niche establishment and growth of the functional yeast that enhances the flavor of baijiu.IMPORTANCE Fermentation of food occurs within communities of interacting species. The importance of microbial interactions in shaping microbial structure and metabolic performance to optimize the traditional fermentation process has long been emphasized, but the interaction mechanisms remain unclear. This study applied metabolome analysis and amplicon sequencing along with metatranscriptomic analysis to examine the volatile organic compound-mediated antifungal activity of Pichia and its effect on the metabolism of ethanol during baijiu fermentation, potentially enhancing the establishment of the fermentation niche and improving ethanol metabolism.",0099-2240,1098-5336,WOS:000640616700018,33608301,

The specific activity was calculated as 10 493.72 U/mg. Strain FSD0302 produced two xylanases with different molecular masses of about 20 and 60 kDa, respectively. The enzymatic properties showed that the optimum temperature was 75 ¡æ for both xylanases, and the optimum pH was 5.5 and 7.5, respectively. Over 50% of the xylanase activity could be retained in the pH range of 3.5-9.0. To sum up, the thermostable xylanase from T. lanuginosus FSD0302 is promising for application in the production of xylooligosaccharides.",1002-6630,,CSCD:6593176,,

[Objective] To revealing the role of environmental factors in driving microbial community succession and flavor metabolism during highland barley Baijiu fermentation. [Methods] Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to compare the changes of flavors during fermentation of dulihuang and walan fermented grains. High throughput sequencing and multivariate statistical analysis were used to compare the microbial structure characteristics in two kinds of fermented grains. The effects of environmental factors on microorganisms were determined by Mantel test and correlation analysis. The results were verified by simulated fermentation in vitro.

Seventy percent of the pollutants in Taihu Lake comes from rivers, with the Yili River being a major source of pollutants. Lakes Xijiu and Dongjiu are connected to the Yili River and Taihu Lake and are sites where material is preferentially deposited because of hydrodynamic conditions. Sediment cores were collected from Xijiu Lake (core XJ-1) and Dongjiu Lake (core DJ-5) to investigate anthropogenic heavy metal contamination. Concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn gradually increased since the late 1930s, peaked in 1970, and then dropped slightly. A sudden increase in concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn occurred in 1991 and peaked again in 1996, then dropped markedly.

A variety of microbes are involved in metabolizing raw materials to produce ethanol and flavor substances during fermentation, which fundamentally determined the quality of baijiu. It is of great importance to study microbial community of fermented grains (zaopei) during baijiu brewing process for improving its quality. In this study, we firstly used propidium monoazide (PMA) to treat zaopei samples from 5-year pit and 20-year pit for removing the interference of non-viable fungi, and analyzed the diversity of total fungi and viable fungi by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) based on ITS2 gene.RESULTS: The results showed that total fungi and viable fungi displayed no significant differences at OTU, phylum, or genus levels during fermentation within two kinds of pits.

During the brewing of Baijiu, the microorganisms in jiuqu produce acetoin and then synthesize TTMP, but the yield of TTMP is very low. In this work, 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH) coding gene BDH1 and another BDH2 gene were deleted or overexpressed to evaluate the effect on the content of acetoin and TTMP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results showed that the acetoin synthesis of strain alpha 5-D1B2 was significantly enhanced by disrupting BDH1 and overexpressing BDH2, leading to a 2.6-fold increase of TTMP production up to 10.55 mg/L. To further improve the production level of TTMP, the alpha-acetolactate synthase (ALS) of the pyruvate decomposition pathway was overexpressed to enhance the synthesis of diacetyl. However, replacing the promoter of the ILV2 gene with a strong promoter (PGK1p) to increase the expression level of the ILV2 gene did not result in further increased diacetyl, acetoin and TTMP production.

Based on traditional culture-dependent methods, these functional enzymes are hardly obtained. According to our previous metatranscriptomic analysis, which identifies plenty of thermostable carbohydrate-active enzymes in NF liquor starter, the aim of this study is to provide a direct and efficient way to mine these thermostable enzymes.Results: In present study, an alpha-amylase (NFAmy13A) gene, which showed the highest expression level of enzymes in starch degradation at high temperature stage (62 degrees C), was directly obtained by functional metatran-scriptomics from Chinese Nong-flavor liquor starter and expressed in Pichia pastoris. NFAmy13A had a typical signal peptide and shared the highest sequence identity of 64% with alpha-amylase from Aspergillus niger. The recombinant enzyme of NFAmy13A showed an optimal pH at 5.0-5.5 and optimal temperature at 60 degrees C. NFAmy13A was activated and stabilized by Ca2+, and its half-lives at 60 and 70 degrees C were improved significantly from 1.5 and 0.4 h to 16 and 0.7 h, respectively, in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2. Meanwhile, Hg2+, Co2+ and SDS largely inhibited its activity. NFAmy13A showed the maximum activity on amylopectin, followed by various starches, amylose, glycogen, and pullulan, and its specificity activity on amylopectin was 200.4 U/mg. Moreover, this alpha-amylase efficiently hydrolyzed starches (from corn, wheat, and potato) at high concentrations up to 15 mg/ml.Conclusions: This study provides a direct way to mine active enzymes from man-made environment of NF liquor starter, by which a fungal thermostable alpha-amylase (NFAmy13A) is successfully obtained. The good characteristics of NFAmy13A in degrading starch at high temperature are consistent with its pivotal role in solid-state fermentation of NF liquor brewing.

The present study aimed to isolate antioxidant peptides from Jiuzao protein hydrolysates, then add these peptides into Baijiu product to enhance the healthy value of Baiju. Meanwhile environmental pollution caused by massive Jiuzao can be mitigated indirectly. RESULTS Four peptides Ala-Tyr-Ile(Leu) (AYI(L)) and Asp-Arg-Glu-Ile(Leu) (DREI(L)) were identified from Jiuzao protein hydrolysates, the extraction contents of AYI + AYL and DREI + DREL were 896.10 and 110.51 mg kg(-1) Jiuzao, respectively. On the one hand, antioxidant activities of these peptides were investigated. For in vitro antioxidant assays, AYI, AYL and DREI exhibited strong capacities in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay. Furthermore, three levels of four peptides were assessed by 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropanimidamidine) (AAPH)-induced HepG2 cells model. The results showed that these peptides exerted a degree of antioxidant activities in cells. Meanwhile, selected peptides concentrations according to cell assays remined at effective doses after in vitro digestion. On the other hand, the influence of these four peptides on the characteristic aroma compounds in Baijiu was studied. Most characteristic aroma compounds releases were increased with the addition of peptides. CONCLUSION In the study, antioxidant activities of peptides were evaluated, the feasibility of utilizing Jiuzao protein hydrolysates to obtain beneficial peptides was also proved.

It is produced by a complex fermentation process that is conducted in pits in the ground. Ethyl caproate is a key flavor compound in CSAL and is thought to originate from caproic acid produced by Clostridia inhabiting the fermentation pit mud. However, the particular species of Clostridium associated with this production are poorly understood and problematic to quantify by culturing. In this study, a total of 28 closest relatives including 15 Clostridia and 8 Bacilli species in pit muds from three CSAL distilleries, were detected by culture-dependent and -independent methods. Among them, Clostridium kluyveri was identified as the main producer of caproic acid. One representative strain C. kluyveri N6 could produce caproic, butyric and octanoic acids and their corresponding ethyl esters, contributing significantly to CSAL flavor. A real time quantitative PCR assay of C kluyveri in pit muds developed showed that a concentration of 1.79 x 10(7) 16S rRNA gene copies/g pit mud in LZ-old pit was approximately six times higher than that in HLM and YH pits and sixty times higher than that in 12-new pit respectively.

Daqu is the starter of fermentation, and pit mud acts as another source of inoculum of microbes in the liquor-making process. However, the contribution of microbes in pit mud and Daqu to fermented grain, and the sources of microbes in fermented grain are still waiting to be defined clearly. In this study, prokaryotic communities in fermented grain, pit mud and Daqu were identified via next generation sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. Principal-coordinate analysis indicated that Daqu had stronger influence on the prokaryotic communities in fermented grain at the prophase of fermentation, but pit mud influenced the fermented grain continuously during the whole fermentation process. Totally, 299 genera were detected in all fermented grain, pit mud and Daqu samples. Among them, 204 genera were detected in 3 days' fermented grain. Ten genera (Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Staphylococcus, Gluconobacter, Acetobacter, Petrimonas, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Methanobacterium and Methanobrevibacter) were dominant, and accounted for 8431%-87.13% relative abundance of the total prokaryotic community in fermented grain. Venn analysis indicated Daqu was the main source of strict aerobes and facultative aerobes, which took up over 74% of prokaryotic communities in fermented grain. Conversely, pit mud was the sustained-release source of anaerobes, which accounted for over 14% of prokaryotic communities in fermented grain. In addition, part of anaerobes originated from both Daqu and pit mud. This study could help track the source of prokaryotic communities in fermented grain, and improve the quality and controllability in liquor production. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Because of this key role, many researches have been conducted in recent years to study the effect of PM microbial mechanisms on the CSFB production. In the present paper, we introduced the recent advances in research on the diversity and succession of PM microbial community, the relationship between microbial community structure and PM quality, and the breeding and application of PM functional microbes. Then, the main associated issues were analyzed and the research prospects were put forward. Firstly, the comparative study on PM microbial community structure should be developed to illustrate the relation between microbial community structure and CSFB quality, and improve the PM quality appraisal system. Secondly, the isolation and improvement of functional strains should be enhanced, and the metabolic pathways and its influence mechanism of isolates should be demonstrated to promote the potential application of PM microbes.

In this context, this study aimed to generate a comprehensive longitudinal characterization of the microbiota during the fermentation processes of Chinese strong-flavor Baijiu (CSFB) differing in cellar ages with consideration for potential relation to physicochemical variables. The microecology variations observed during the 6-years cellar SSF (SCSSF) and 30-years cellar SSF (TCSSF) processes reveal that fungal composition contributes to a larger extent than bacterial composition to such variations.

Compared with the SCSSF process, TCSSF possessed slower microbial succession rates, which were in accordance with the profile of physicochemical properties. From a network perspective, the microbial community structure observed in the TCSSF processes was more stable than that in the SCSSF.

In this study, microbial community succession and volatile flavors during sauce-flavor Baijiu fermentation at different initial temperatures (LT group: 28 +/- 2 degrees C and HT group: 37 +/- 2 degrees C) were investigated using Illumina Miseq sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). First, we found that different initial temperatures had a significant effect on fermentation parameters (P < 0.001); specifically, a higher initial temperature increased the accumulation of acetic acid and decreased the production of ethanol. Second, the microbial communities were characterized by decreased alpha-diversity and increased beta-diversity (P < 0.05) during heap fermentation. A higher initial temperature accelerated the increase in Lactobacillus and led to a faster microbial succession rate. Lactobacillus could be used as microbial markers of microbial succession rate in sauce-flavor Baijiu fermentation. Next, we found that acetic acid drove microbial succession under a higher fermentation temperature. Molecular ecological network analysis showed that different fermentation temperatures affected microbial interactions. The higher temperature enhanced microbial interactions of Lactobacillus. In addition, 50 volatile flavors were identified in the fermented grains. High temperature increased the content of total acid and reduced total esters, and Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces were the important microbiota related to different flavor compounds between the two groups.

Two fault systems were distinguished in the Namche Barwa area. The former includes a top-down-to-the-north normal fault in the north and two top-to-the-south thrust zones in the south named as Upper and Lower Thrusts, respectively. The Namche Barwa and Pei sequences were exhumed southwards from beneath the Dongjiu sequence by these faults. Thus, the fault system is regarded as a southward extrusion structure. Subsequently, the exposed Dongjiu, Namche Barwa, Pei and Laiguo sequences were displaced northwards onto the Lhasa terrain by the top-to-the-north fault system, thus, marking it as northward indentation structure. Monazite TIMS U-Pb dating demonstrates that the normal fault and the Lower Thrust from the southward extrusion system were probably active at similar to 6 Ma and similar to 10 Ma, respectively. Zircon U-Pb SHRIMP and phlogopite K-Ar ages further suggest that the Upper Thrust was active between 62 +/- 0.2 Ma and 5.5 +/- 0.2 Ma. The northward indentation structures within the core portion of the eastem Himalayan syntaxis were perhaps active between 3.0 Ma and 1.5 Ma, as inferred by published zircon U-Pb SHRIMP and hornblende Ar-Ar ages. The monazite from upper portions of the Pei sequence dated by U-Pb TIMS indicates that the precursor sediments of this sequence were derived from Proterozoic source regions. Nd isotopic data further suggest that all the metamorphic rocks within eastern Himalaya (epsilon Nd = -13 to -19) correlate closely with those from the Greater Himalayan Sequences, whereas the western Himalayan syntaxis is mainly comprised of Lesser Himalayan Sequences.

[Methods] The dominant genera and community structure transition were revealed by high-throughput sequencing. The distribution of metabolic pathways in prokaryotic microbial community during SSF was predicted by PICRUSt. The interpretation rate of physicochemical properties to microbial community composition was revealed by correlation analysis. The effect of physicochemical properties on community composition was verified by simulating fermentation under laboratory conditions.

Results showed that ethyl acetate was the main flavour component of JZ-127, JZ-34, and JX, whereas ethyl lactate was mainly detected in JN-2, JN-3, and LZ-19. Ethyl lactate accounted for half of the ethyl acetate content, and JX exhibited a higher liquor yield than the other sorghum varieties. The fermented grains of waxy sorghum presented higher temperature and reducing sugar contents but lower moisture and starch contents than their non-waxy counterparts during fermentation. We selected JN-3 and JX sorghum varieties to further investigate the microbial changes in the fermented grains. The bacterial diversity gradually reduced, whereas the fungal diversity showed nearly no change in either JN-3 or JX. Lactobacillus was the most abundant bacterial genus, and its level rapidly increased during fermentation. The abundance of Lactobacillus accounted for the total proportion of bacteria in JX, and it was higher than that in JN-3. Saccharomyces was the most abundant fungal genus in JX, but its abundance accounted for a small proportion of fungi in JN-3.

The results showed that the relative abundance of Thermoactinomyces was significantly positively correlated with Daqu temperature. As Daqu temperature rising, the potential heat resistance genes,such as Clp ( K03695) ,groEL ( K04077) ,and pstB ( K02036) in Thermoactinomyces enriched into dominant genes and were significantly positively correlated with Daqu temperature,which could effectively promote Thermoactinomyces surviving at high temperature.

Furthermore, CWC inhibited AAPH-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells with a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of the cells with CWC (1, 2, and 4 mg/mL) caused the strong scavenging activities on the intracellular reactive oxygen species and a marked decrease in the reduced malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, pretreatment with CWC prevented significantly the activities decrease in glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) induced by AAPH. CWC had strong antioxidant activity mainly due to its Cys residue containing a thiol group (-SH).

High-throughput sequencing, headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, principal component analysis, community composition analysis, and redundancy analysis were used to analyze and evaluate the impact of environmental factors on microbial communities and flavor substances.RESULTS: Six genera of bacteria (e.g., Caproiciproducens, Syntrophaceticus, Sedimentibacter, Hydrogenispora, Pelotomaculum and Bacillus) and seven genera of fungi (Cladosporium, Debaryomyces, Dipodascus, Auxarthron, Cephalotrichum, unclassified Stachybotryaceae, unclassified Microascaceae and Cephalotrichum) notably affected the production of hexanoic acid (an important flavor compound). Moisture and alcohol content also had considerable effects on the production of the flavor compounds such as ethyl lactate, hexanoic acid, and ethyl hexanoate. The profiles of volatile compounds present in ZP were different between the aged and new pits; these profiles were mainly reflected in the concentration and types of alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and aromatic compounds.CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the physicochemical parameters, flavor substances, and microbial population distribution of ZP.

Thus, changes in absolute abundance of microbiota cannot be determined, which hinders further microbiology research. We have therefore established a gradient internal standard absolute quantification (GIS-AQ) method to overcome this issue, which can simultaneously obtain the absolute abundances of bacteria and fungi. Deviations from the quantitative equations of microbes and internal standards were eliminated through calibration. Compared with traditional quantitative real-time PCR and microscopy quantifications, this method is reliable (R-average(2) = 0.998; P < 0.001) and accurate (P-internals versus microscopy > 0.05). The GIS-AQ method can be adapted to any amplicon primer choice (e.g., 336F/806R and ITS3/ITS4), rendering it applicable to ecosystem studies including food, soil, and water samples. Crucially, when using solid-state fermentation samples from various temporal dimensions, the results obtained from the relative and absolute abundance are different. The absolute abundance can be used to study the difference in communities between different samples, and the GIS-AQ method allows this to be done rapidly. Therefore, combining the absolute abundance with relative abundance can accurately reflect the microbiota composition.IMPORTANCE To solve the problem of amplicon sequencing cannot discern the microbiota absolute abundance, we proposed a gradient internal standard absolute quantification method. We used Chinese liquor fermentation as a model system to demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the method. By comparing the relative and absolute abundances of microbiota in various temporal dimensions, we found dynamic changes in the absolute abundance of communities under various temporal dimensions from the relative abundance.

Results show that the quantity and distribution of the microbial flora in the diverse environment of high-temperature Daqu, stacking fermentation, and bacterial community are identical. The differences in the ecological environment between high-temperature Daqu and stacking fermentation leads to dominance of different bacteria. The dominant microorganisms in the high-temperature production process included Clostridium sensu stricto (cluster I), Escherichia-Shigella, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Alternaria, Issatchenkia, Pyrenochaetopsis, and Pichia, whereas the dominant microorganisms of fermented grains in stacking fermentation included Escherichia-Shigella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium sensu stricto (cluster I), Streptococcus, Actinobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Alternaria. In agreement with flavor characteristics, the activities of protease, lipase, alpha-amylase, and glucoamylase in the second round of fermentation showed regular changes. The activities of protease, lipase, and alpha-amylase in the high-temperature stacking process were higher than that in in-pit fermentation. However, glucoamylase activity showed an opposite trend. The contents of some acids, such as acetic acid, isobutyric acid, and propionic acid in the in-pit fermentation were higher than those in stacking fermentation, whereas ethyl lactate content showed a different trend.

Clinical and animal studies have shown that Xiaojin Pills has the effects of anti-mammary glands hyperplasia, promoting blood circulation, anti-inflammation and analgesia. However, its initial administration method was taking orally after soaked with Chinese Baijiu, the modern method was changed to taking orally with water in recent 20 years. Whether there is any difference in the efficacy of the two administration methods is still unknown.Aim of the study: To reveal the difference in efficacy and metabolic mechanism of anti-mammary gland hyperplasia between the oral administration of Xiaojin Pills accompanied with Chinese Baijiu (XJP&B) and water (XJP&W).Materials and methods: COX-2 inhibition rate test and anti-platelet aggregation activity test were used to investigate the efficacy difference between the 40 vol% Chinese Baijiu and water extracts of Xiaojin Pills on antiinflammatory and blood-activating in vitro. Kunming male mice (20 +/- 5 g) and SD female rats (200-220 g) were orally treated with XJP&B and XJP&W, respectively. Then the difference in anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects between XJP&B and XJP&W were evaluated via xylene-induced ear swelling test, formaldehyde induced pain test, and acetic acid-induced writhing test in mice. Determination of nipple diameter, pathological examination of mammary gland tissue, determination of serum E2, P and FSH content and hemorheological parameters of rats with mammary gland hyperplasia were performed to explore the efficacy difference in anti mammary gland hyperplasia between XJP&B and XJP&W. Metabolomics was used to study the difference of anti-mammary gland hyperplasia mechanism between XJP&B and XJP&W.Results: The results showed that the effect of XJP&B was superior to that of XJP&W in anti-platelet aggregation, inhibition of inflammation and pain, and anti-mammary gland hyperplasia. Interestingly, the advantages were more significant under low-dose condition. In addition, the mechanism of the two combinations against mammary gland hyperplasia was indeed different. Their common metabolic pathways include tryptophan metabolism and alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid metabolism. However, Chinese Baijiu and XJP&B also have additional regulatory effects on linoleic acid metabolic pathway.Conclusion: In brief, this research demonstrated that the efficacy of XJP&B was better than that of XJP&W in activating the blood, anti-inflammation, analgesia and anti-mammary gland hyperplasia, which means that XJP&B has synergistic and superior effects. The special dose-effect relationship under the condition of XJP&B was also found, laying the foundation for clinical treatment to reduce the dosage and shorten the medication cycle, which is beneficial to reduce the economic burden of patients.",0378-8741,1872-7573,WOS:000696990200004,34111538,

Owing to their high concentrations, compounds such as ethyl hexanoate, butyric acid, hexanoic acid, ethyl pentadecanoate, ethyl palmitate, ethyl (9E)-9-octadecenoate, ethyl (9E,12E)-9,12-octadecadienoate, and palmitic acid were considered to be predominant volatiles. A promising artificial neural network model, the Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), was applied to rapidly discriminate the PM samples in terms of differences based on the quantitative information of volatile compounds. After Kohonen SOM training, 13 distinct clusters, corresponding to PM samples, were clearly visualized on a uniform distance matrix (U-matrix).

Subsequently,the differences between microbial communities of the two seasons were analyzed via random forest method. Finally,mechanism of synthesis and regulation of higher alcohols were determined by correlation analysis with simulated solid-state fermentation. The total amount of higher alcohols produced in the samples of spring was (179.43 9.57) mg /kg,and the yield was higher in that of autumn,reaching (276.86 26.80) mg /kg.

Here, in an experimental mouse model, we show that CB caused lower degrees of liver injury than pure EtOH by protecting against the decrease of the relative abundance of Akkermansia and increase of the relative abundance of Prevotella in the gut, thereby preventing the destruction of the intestinal barrier. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EtOH-induced alteration of the gut microbiota profoundly affected the host metabolome.

Moreover, their pivotal and complicated functions in Daqu are completely unknown.Results In this study, a novel alpha -amylase NFAmy13B, from GH13_5 subfamily (according to the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes Database, CAZy) was successfully heterologous expressed by Escherichia coli from Chinese Nong-flavor (NF) Daqu. It exhibited high stability ranging from pH 5.5 to 12.5, and higher specific activity, compared to other GH13_5 fungal alpha -amylases. Moreover, NFAmy13B did not show activity loss and retained 96% residual activity after pre-incubation at pH 11 for 21 h and pH 12 for 10 h, respectively. Additionally, 1.25 mM Ca2+ significantly improved its thermostability. NFAmy13B showed a synergistic effect on degrading wheat starch with NFAmy13A (GH13_1), another alpha -amylase from Daqu. Both enzymes could cleave maltotetraose and maltopentaose in same degradation pattern, and only NFAmy13A could efficiently degrade maltotriose.

Bacillus and Lactobacillus were the main bacterial genera. Pichia anomala, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatchenkia orientalis were the dominant yeast species. There was a close relationship between fermentation time and the shift of microbial community. Compared with the microbiota in the fermentation of other style liquors, higher bacterial diversity and different non-Saccharomyces composition led to a variety of metabolites. Metabolite analysis showed that esters, acids, alcohols, aromatic compounds and phenols were the main flavour components and most of them were synthesised in the latter phase of fermentation. Principal component analysis further demonstrated that Bacillus and yeast were the most influential microorganisms in the first 10 days of fermentation, and lactic acid bacteria predominated in the later phase. Lactic acid bacteria regulated the composition of other bacteria and yeast, and synthesised flavour compounds to affect the organoleptic properties of liquor. S. cerevisiae and P. anomala were two important yeast species responsible for the characteristic aroma of liquor.

The uplift and exhumation history are often by one of two leading models: a stationary or localized tectonic aneurysm or a northeasterly migrating crustal antiform. Previous researchers have placed great emphasis on the core zone of Namche Barwa antiform. However, the Dongjiu-Milin Fault Zone (DMFZ), which forms the northwestern boundary of the antiform and plays an important role for deformation process in the EHS, is still poorly understood. In this study, we focus on differential late-Cenozoic uplift across the DMFZ. We collected 10 bedrock samples in two vertical transects, one on the northwest side of the DMFZ on the Lhasa block and one on the southeast side on the Namche Barwa antiform, and conducted apatite fission track and zircon fission track analyses. Ten samples collected from the two vertical transects yield AFT ages between 3.2 million years ago (Ma) and 10.3 Ma and ZFT ages between 9.9 Ma and 12.9 Ma. A finite-element analysis reveals that the two sides of the DMFZ have undergone quite different uplift histories and processes in the late-Cenozoic: The Lhasa block is uniformly uplifted, while the Namche Barwa antiform is nonuniformly uplifted similar to a buckle fold. The phenomenon revealed in this study is best explained by a mechanism whereby the EHS is characterized by the northeasterly migration of an antiform.",1367-9120,1878-5786,WOS:000472686600014,,

Pit mud quality, according to its sensory characteristics, can be divided into three grades: degraded, normal, and high quality. However, the relationship between pit mud microbial community and pit mud quality is poorly understood, as are microbial associations within the pit mud ecosystem. Here, microbial communities at these grades were compared using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the variable region V4 of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results revealed that the pit mud microbial community was correlated with its quality and environmental factors. Species richness, biodiversity, and relative and/or absolute abundances of Clostridia, Clostridium kluyveri, Bacteroidia, and Methanobacteria significantly increased, with corresponding increases in levels of pH, NH4 (+), and available phosphorus, from degraded to high-quality pit muds, while levels of Lactobacillus, dissolved organic carbon, and lactate significantly decreased, with normal samples in between. Furthermore, 271 pairs of significant and robust correlations (cooccurrence and negative) were identified from 76 genera using network analysis.

Recent research and long-term practice have highlighted the key roles of microbes inhabiting pit mud in the formation of SFB's characteristic flavor. A positive correlation between the quality of SFB and cellar age was extracted from practice; however, the evolutionary patterns of pit mud microbiome and driving factors remain unclear. Here, based on the variation regularity analysis of microbial community structure and metabolites of samples from cellars of different ages (similar to 30/100/300 years), we further investigated the effects of lactate and acetate (main microbial metabolites in fermented grains) on modulating the pit mud microbiome. Esters (50.3% to 64.5%) dominated the volatile compounds identified in pit mud, and contents of the four typical acids (lactate, hexanoate, acetate, and butyrate) increased with cellar age. Bacteria (9.5 to 10.4 log(10) [Ig] copies/g) and archaea (8.3 to 9.1 lg copies/g) mainly constituted pit mud microbiota, respectively dominated by Clostridia (39.7% to 81.2%) and Methanomicrobia (32.8% to 92.9%). An upward trend with cellar age characterized the relative and absolute abundance of the most predominant bacterial and archaeal genera, Caproiciproducens and Methanosarcina. Correlation analysis revealed significantly (P < 0.05) positive relationships between the two genera and major metabolites. Anaerobic fermentation with acetate and lactate as carbon sources enhanced the enrichment of Clostridia, and furthermore, the relative abundance of Caproiciproducens (40.9%) significantly increased after 15-day fed-batch fermentation with lactate compared with the initial pit mud (0.22%). This work presents a directional evolutionary pattern of pit mud microbial consortia and provides an alternative way to accelerate the enrichment of functional microbes.IMPORTANCE The solid-state anaerobic fermentation in a mud cellar is the most typical feature of strong-flavor baijiu (SFB). Metabolites produced by microbes inhabiting pit mud are crucial to create the unique flavor of SFB. Accordingly, craftspeople have always highlighted the importance of the pit mud microbiome and concluded by centuries of practice that the production rate of high-quality baijiu increases with cellar age. To deepen the understanding of the pit mud microbiome, we determined the microbial community and metabolites of different-aged pit mud, inferred the main functional groups, and explored the forces driving the microbial community evolution through metagenomic, metabolomic, and multivariate statistical analyses. The results showed that the microbial consortia of pit mud presented a regular and directional evolutionary pattern under the impact of continuous batch-tobatch brewing activities. This work provides insight into the key roles of the pit mud microbiome in SFB production and supports the production optimization of highquality pit mud.",0099-2240,1098-5336,WOS:000693759300017,34160281,

Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis differentiated FG3 from other samples based on content of aroma compounds. FG3 had the highest level of aroma compounds, which increased from the fourth to sixth batches, and was characterised by the presence of 1, 2-propanediol, acetic acid and linoleic acid, while the others were portrayed by phenylpropionate, ethyl laurate and 4-ethyl guaiacol. The volatile compounds of raw liquor were dominated by ethyl acetate and ethyl lactate. Correlation analysis illustrated a lack of correlation of volatile compound content between the raw liquors and the zaopei distillation variants.

This study investigated the protective effects of PHP on 2,2-azobis (2-methyl-propanimidamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells and the involved molecular mechanisms. Pretreatment with PHP suppressed the generations of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), prevented a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH), and up-regulated the activities of cellular antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, PHP treatment stimulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2). Meanwhile, PHP markedly reduced the level of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), suggesting that PHP effectively activated Nrf2/antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated activity.

However, the microorganisms responsible for lactic acid production have not been identified. In this work, the dynamic changes in bacterial community structure in the Zaosha round (second sorghum feeding and fermentation) of the brewing process were analysed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Results show that lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Bacillus spp. are the dominant bacteria in the brewing process, where Bacillus spp. are found in the early stage, whilst LAB are found throughout the brewing process. Furthermore, 10 types of LAB and five Bacillus spp. were isolated from Zaopei (a mixture of fermented grains including sorghum and wheat) by a culture-dependent method. Lactobacillus panis accounts for 68% of the LAB, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens for 54% of Bacillus spp. Solid-state fermentation experiments were performed with L. panis and B. amyloliquefaciens and lactic acid production was consistent with the accumulation of lactic acid in Zaosha. The results showed that L. panis was the main producer of lactic acid in pits, while B. amyloliquefaciens plays an important role in the production of lactic acid in the early stages of fermentation. The approach used in this study may facilitate the identification of key microorganisms with specific functionality involved in other food and beverage fermentation processes.

In this study Illumina Miseq sequencing platform was first applied to study the bacterial succession in Zaopei during liquor fermentation processes in winter and summer. The research results showed that 10 phyla and 13 families were detected in Zaopei. Differences in bacterial communities of summer and winter Zaopei were apparent. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in winter Zaopei. However, bacteria belonging to Firmicutes were most frequently detected in summer Zaopei. The diverse genera decreased sharply at the first half of the 40-day fermentation stage, and then bacterial population were mainly represented by Acetobacter and Lactobacillus both in winter and summer Zaopei. Interestingly, the summer Zaopei contained significantly higher proportions of LAB and lower proportions of Acetobacter than winter Zaopei. Clustering analysis also revealed that bacterial community structure was distinct between the Zaopei fermented in the two seasons.

To accomplish this, we used a combination of clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes, bar-coded pyrosequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS1), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Fifteen families of bacteria and six families of fungi were detected. More than 91% of 16S rRNA gene sequences could be assigned to the family Lactobacillaceae, which were then classified to eight different operational taxonomic units (OTUs), based on a 3% cut-off. The most abundant OTU which contributed to 51% of the total 16S rRNA gene sequences was affiliated with Lactobacillus acetotolerans and had a significantly similar variation trend with the chemical constituents detected. Sixty percent of the fungal ITS1 region sequences were affiliated with the family Saccharomycetaceae. The most abundant OTU was very similar to Issatchenkia orientalis, which displayed notable similarities with respect to the change trends in both ethanol and organic acid contents. The sequences of the second most abundant OTU were closest to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an important species in the process of ethanol production. Furthermore, about one fourth of the ITS1 region sequences belonged to the family Saccharomycopsidaceae. Conversely, very few sequences could be grouped together with filamentous fungi. The results of qPCR showed that the content of bacteria was increased while that of fungi was more stable in the fermentation process. It is very important to simultaneously investigate bacterial and fungal variations in food-fermentation processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Spectroscopy together with the pattern recognition technology is a preferred method of achieving rapid identification of wine quality, in which the Raman Spectroscopy is promising because of its little affection of water and little or free of sample pretreatment. So, in this paper, Raman spectra and support vector regression (SVR) are used to recognize different ages and different storing time of the liquor of the same age. The innovation of this paper is mainly reflected in the following three aspects. First, the application of Raman in the area of liquor analysis is rarely reported till now. Second, the concentration of studying the recognition of wine age, while most studies focus on studying specific components of liquor and studies together with the pattern recognition method focus more on the identification of brands or different types of base wine. The third one is the application of regression analysis framework, which cannot be only used to identify different years of liquor, but also can be used to analyze different storing time, which has theoretical and practical significance to the research and quality control of liquor. Three kinds of experiments are conducted in this paper. Firstly, SVR is used to recognize different ages of 5, 8, 16 and 26 years of the Gujing Liquor; secondly, SVR. is also used to classify the storing time of the 8-years liquor; thirdly, certain group of train data is deleted form the train set and put into the test set to simulate the actual situation of liquor age recognition.

It is characterized by a thick sequence of highly strained and ductilely deformed mylonite (sensu stricto and sensu lato) bound between a pair of sub-parallel transtensive brittle normal faults. An integrated geochronological, petrographic, and thermobarometric study of three samples of pelitic and semi-pelitic mylonite (sensu lato) from the shear zone provides new insights into its thermal and structural evolution, and hence the tectonic processes operating in the region since the India-Asia collision. U-Th-Pb in-situ dating of monazite, garnet-ilmenite thermometry, and textural relationships show that mylonitization and peak-thermal staurolite-grade metamorphism occurred at 23.4 +/- 0.7 Ma at a temperature of at least similar to 610 +/- 30 degrees C. Cooling of these units through 420-500 degrees C occurred at c. 11-8 Ma, as constrained by the retrograde breakdown of allanite to form monazite. These data show that the cooling history of mylonite (sensu lato) in the shear zone and the tectonic evolution of the syntaxis region can be divided into two distinct stages. Slow cooling at a rate of 6-12 degrees C/Myr during c. 23-8 Ma is attributed to exhumation during ductile deformation and mylonitization caused by the ongoing India-Asia collision. This was followed by a period of significantly faster cooling at a minimum rate of 57 degrees C/Myr since c. 8 Ma, most likely associated with brittle normal faulting that facilitated the final stages of excavation to the surface. These new thermochronological data provide evidence of deep-seated exhumation-related cooling processes occurring in a convergent margin orogenic setting.

However, the fermentation process was not fully understood owing to the complicate community structure and metabolism. In this study, the process-related dynamics of microbial communities and main flavor compounds during the 70-day fermentation process were investigated in a simulated fermentation system.Results: A three-phase model was proposed to characterize the process of the CSFL fermentation. (i) In the early fermentation period (1-23 days), glucose was produced from macromolecular carbohydrates (e.g., starch). The prokaryotic diversity decreased significantly. The Lactobacillaceae gradually predominated in the prokaryotic community. In contrast, the eukaryotic diversity rose remarkably in this stage. Thermoascus, Aspergillus, Rhizopus and unidentified Saccharomycetales were dominant eukaryotic members. (ii) In the middle fermentation period (23-48 days), glucose concentration decreased while lactate acid and ethanol increased significantly. Prokaryotic community was almost dominated by the Lactobacillus, while eukaryotic community was mainly comprised of Thermoascus, Emericella and Aspergillus. (iii) In the later fermentation period (48-70 days), the concentrations of ethyl esters, especially ethyl caproate, increased remarkably.Conclusions: The CSFL fermentation could undergo three stages: saccharification, glycolysis and esterification. Saccharomycetales, Monascus, and Rhizopus were positively correlated to glucose concentration (P < 0.05), highlighting their important roles in the starch saccharification. The Lactobacillaceae, Bacilli, Botryotinia, Aspergillus, unidentified Pleosporales and Capnodiales contributed to the glycolysis and esterification, because they were positively correlated to most organic acids and ethyl esters (P < 0.05).

The band number, dominance, diversity and similarity of the 16S rDNA differed in the DGGE patterns, reflecting the wide diversity of the microbial communities present in the different phases. The band abundance and dominance of the eukaryotic microbial community varied in the different phases. To provide insight into factors contributing to this diversity, the physicochemical properties of Daqu were explored. The core temperature of Daqu gradually increased to a maximum during the Dinghuo phase followed by a decline. The moisture and starch content decreased throughout fermentation. The total acid, reducing sugar, amino nitrogen, alpha-amylase activity, glucoamylase activity, protease activity, bacterial and mould number increased gradually to a maximum value at the end of the Peijun phase before decreasing in the Dinghuo phase increasing slightly in the Huanluo phase and then remaining almost unchanged. The esterase activity exhibited a similar change to that of other enzymes and then slightly increased after the Peijun stage. For yeasts, the highest number was obtained at the Peijun stage and then decreased. Correlation analysis revealed that the diversity of both bacteria and fungi was negatively correlated with moisture and starch and positively correlated with other indices. The reducing sugar, amino nitrogen, alpha-amylase and protease activities showed significant positive correlation with bacteria, and glucoamylase and esterase showed significant correlation with fungi.

[Objective] This study aimed to analyze prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities during the high-temperature stacking process. [Methods] Illumina high-throughput sequencing was performed on the bacterial 16S rDNA V3-V4 region and the fungal ITS2 region of the high-temperature stacked Jiupei samples. The change pattern of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial community structure were analyzed. The changes in temperature, moisture, acidity, starch and reduced-sugar during stacking were also analyzed. [Results] At the beginning of 0-6 hours, the dominant bacteria were Bacillus, Weissella, and Acetobacter. After 20 h of stacking, the flora changed significantly. Weissella decreased and the Acetobacter increased. At the beginning, the dominant fungi were Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, and Pichia. After 6 hours, the proportion of Aspergillus dropped sharply, while Pichia and Saccharomyces gradually increased, and their absolute dominance maintained until the end of the stacking. The overall structure of the microbial community was temporarily affected by the turn-over operation (when it was piled up for 20 h), eventually returning to equilibrium. After 36 h of stacking, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial community stabilized. Reduced-sugar data showed that the saccharification was rapid in the early stage, later became stable after 36 h. Temperature, acidity and starch content were also stable at this stage. [Conclusion] During the high-temperature stacking-fermentation process, fluctuation patterns of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial community structure were different. The prokaryotic community changes were based on the turn-up at 20 h. The dominant species before the turn-up were Bacillus, Weissella and Acetobacte, the dominant strains after the turn-up were Weissella and Acetobacter, the latter was absolute dominant. Compared to prokaryotic community changes, the eukaryotic microbial community concentration gradually, by the end of the stacking, Pichia and Saccharomyces accounted for more than 93% of the total eukaryotic microbial. During the high-temperature stacking of the sesame-flavor Baijiu, the propagation of various prokaryotic/eukaryotic microbes and the corresponding changes of microbial communities laid the microbial basis for later high-temperature fermentation.",0253-2654,,CSCD:6507773,,

Results displayed that the total higher alcohol concentration in alpha 5 Delta GDH1 strain decreased by 27.31% to 348.68 mg/L compared with that of alpha 5.

This PM, specific fermented clay, contains microbes that play important roles in CSFL production. However, there is limited information about fungal community structure and cellar-age-related changes in PM. In this study, PM samples were removed from the cellars used for 5 and 100 years and characterized using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Both methods revealed there were no significant differences in fungal species diversity (Shannon index, Chao1, and observed species) between the 5- and 100-year PM samples (p > 0.05), but the communities were more stable in the 100-year PM samples (UPGMA). Illumina MiSeq sequencing allowed identification of 111 fungal genera belonging to 4 phyla (Ascomycota, Zygomycota, Basidiomycota, and Chytridiomycota) in the PM samples, with the predominant phylum being Ascomycota. The results also indicated that the compositions of dominant genera in the PM samples were significantly changed during long-term CSFL fermentation. There were relatively more Rhizopus, Phoma, and Trichosporon in the 5-year PM samples, and Aspergillus and Candida were most highly represented in the 100-year PM samples (p < 0.05). Of these, Candida increased its relative abundance significantly in the 100-year samples (p < 0.05). Overall, the results provide novel insights into the fungal community associated with CSFL production, and may suggest why fermentation in a cellar with PM that has been in usage for a longer time allows better quality CSFL production.

Therefore, mycotoxins may exist in Daqu, resulting in the contamination of end-foods. Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin produced by certain species of Aspergillus and Penicilliurn, is not known whether existing in Daqu. However, specific method to detect OTA as well as OTA occurrence in Daqu has not been reported so far. With this in mind, a new method was developed to detect OTA in Daqu by the combination of ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction (USLE), solid phase extraction (SPE) cleanup and UPLC-MS/MS. The USLE conditions of OTA from Daqu were optimized using Plackett-Burman (PB) design coupled with Box-Behnken (BB) design. Under the optimized conditions, no matrix effects were found, and the external standard method can be used to determine OTA in Daqu. The recoveries for spiked samples were 87-106% with the relative standard deviations (RSD) < 15%. The limits of detection and quantification were respectively 0.33 and 0.41 ppb. This approach was then applied to analyze 133 Daqu samples from different geographical regions in China, including 26 low temperature-, 33 medium temperature- and 74 high temperature-type Daqu. The results showed that OTA was detected in 66 samples with a maximum concentration of 28.87 ppb in low temperature Daqu, and the OTA incidence was on increase in the order of high temperature-, medium temperature- and low temperature-type Daqu. This implied that fermentation temperature is the key factor influencing OTA occurrence in Daqu.

The results showed that the SDS-phenol and CTAB methods were inexpensive, while the kit method was the most time saving but most expensive. The total RNA concentration extracted by the kit method was the highest, which was 1.84, 2.33, 19.14 and 3.09 times as high as that by the modified SDS-phenol, Trizol, CTAB and sodium laurate methods, respectively.

The electrophoresis showed more intact bands for total RNA extracted by the SDS-phenol method as compared to that extracted by the other methods, and but no bands for total RNA extracted the by the CTAB method. RNA extracted by the modified SDS-phenol, kit and Trizol methods could be efficiently reversely transcribed into cDNA and used for high-throughput sequencing analysis. The sequencing results showed that the dominant microbial genera (Lactobacillus and Clostridium) obtained by the three RNA extraction methods and the change of microbial population abundance in fermented grains at different fermentation times were basically the same. Among the three methods, the SDS-phenol method gave the highest diversity of microbial communities and could be useful to determine the differences in microbial groups among fermented grains at different fermentation times.

The bacterial species in Daqu and Fuqu were mainly thermophilic or thermotolerant. In Daqu, the dominant bacterial species were Thermoactinomyces sanguinis (53.85%) and Pantoea agglomerans (19.23%), followed by uncultured bacteria (15.39%). The lactic acid bacterium Weissella cibaria (50%) and a member of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterobacter ludwigii (10%), were the dominant bacterial species in Xiaoqu. Low abundances of other bacteria, including Deinococcus radiodurans, Corynebacterium variabile and Acinetobacter baumannii, were reported for Xiaoqu.

The total yield of DREL in Jiuzao was 158.24 mg kg(-1)Jiuzao under the pepsin's optimum hydrolysis conditions determined by response surface methodology analysis (RSMA). In addition, DREL could activate the Nrf2/Keap1-p38/PI3K-MafK signaling pathway and downstream antioxidant enzymes to improve the antioxidant ability in vivo. DREL also preliminarily exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and the mediator through the activation of Nrf2.

An important part of Daqu production is aging, but the physicochemical and microbial changes during aging remain largely unknown. This study characterized aging according to physicochemical parameters, volatile compounds, and microbial communities. Aging was found to aid in the stabilization of the physicochemical parameters. Solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect 72 types of volatile compounds, which were predominantly alcohols, esters, aldehydes, alkenes, and alkanes. During aging, these compounds changed considerably, but their structures eventually stabilized. A high-throughput sequencing approach was used to analyze the changing composition of the microbial communities. In general, aging helped to enrich and stabilize the microbial population for making Baijiu. A total of 35 bacteria were detected as prokaryotic; among these, 15 had a diversity abundance ratio of more than 1%. The dominant bacteria were from the genus Pantoea, but these decreased with aging, while bacteria from Lactobacillus and Weissella increased. After aging for 2 months, Pantoea, Lactobacillus and Weissella accounted for 0.4%, 54.0%, and 18.9%, respectively. A total of 12 eukaryotic yeast and fungi were detected, the most abundant of which were Incertae_Sedis_incertae_sedis, Saccharomycopsis, Trichocomaceae unclassified, Pichia, Tremellales_unclassified, and Galactomyces. During aging, the levels of Trichocomaceae_unclassified, Saccharomycopsis, and Galactomyces initially decreased but then increased. Pichia stayed unchanged as aging progressed. In conclusion, aging led to rebalanced interactions among Daqu microbes and was important in improving Daqu quality and ensuring its stability. (C) 2018, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

The results showed that the total nitrogen(TN) and nitrate nitrogen(NN) content in the soil increased by 35.79%-365.26% and 122.96%-171.80%, the microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) content decreased by 34.10%-59.95%, and the AN/TN, NN/TN, and MBN/TN exhibited a decreasing trend with an increase in the amount of biochar applied. The application of vinasse biochar significantly reduced the number of OTU and community richness and diversity of soil bacteria; the influence degree increased with an increase in the application amount of vinasse biochar. In comparison with the MB0 treatment, the application of biochar significantly changed the soil bacterial community structure.

The application of vinasse biochar increased the relative abundance of certain soil functional bacteria, such as Streptomyces and Pusillimonas, and simultaneously also decreased the relative abundance of the dominant bacteria, such as Lysobacter and Gemmatimonas. In addition, the redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the MBN/TN, NN, and MBN were the main cause of soil bacterial community structure change in nitrogen environment factor. The MBN/TN and MBN exhibited a significantly positive correlation with Thaumarchaeota and Nitrospira, which indicated that the short-term application of vinasse biochar can significantly reduce the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nitrifying bacteria, inhibit the ammonia-oxidizing effect and nitrification rate of soil, and improve the availability of soil nitrogen.

With the expansion of production scale of CAB, innovative strategies for efficient production of aged pork fat are in great demand. The purpose of this study is to accelerate the lipid oxidation of pork fat and improve the productivity of aged pork fat. RESULTS Results showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were the main reactant; generation reactions of lipid peroxides and free fatty acids (FFAs) were two limiting steps during the preparation of aged pork fat. Processing under illumination could alleviate the first limiting step by increasing the peroxide value andp-anisidine value of pork fat to 16.22- and 28.48-fold higher than control samples and simultaneously the PUFAs were increased to 190.60 +/- 0.19 g kg(-1). Soaking in basic liquor with deeply oxidized fat oil could alleviate the second limiting step by transferring FFAs from fat oil into pork fat. With more oxidized PUFAs, the acid value of the pork fat was 7.91-fold higher than that of the control. CONCLUSION Illumination and deeply oxidized fat oil could alleviate the two rate-limiting steps of lipid oxidation and improve the productivity of aged pork fat significantly.

The purpose of this work was to study the process of microfiltration of Tongbi liquor (TBL), a popular Chinese herbal drink, using ceramic membranes. Zirconium oxide and aluminum oxide membranes with pore mean sizes of 0.2 mu m and 0.05 mu m, respectively, are used for comparisons in terms of flux, transmittance of the ingredients, physical-chemical parameters, removal of macromolecular materials and fouling resistance. The results show that 0.2 mu m zirconium oxide membrane is more suitable. The stable permeate flux reaches 135 L.h(-1).m(-2), the cumulative transmittance of the indicator is 65.53%. Macromolecular materials, such as starch, protein, tannin, pectin and total solids were largely eliminated in retentate after filtration using 0.2 mu m ZrO2 ceramic membrane, resulting in clearer TBL. Moreover, this work also reveals that continuous ultrasound could strengthen membrane process that the permeate flux increases significantly.

It is of deep significance and market value to study year liquor. The concentration of monomer in liquor will change with liquor age, so the detection of monomer concentration in liquor can be used to identify liquor quality and age. In this paper, based on the three-dimensional fluorescence spectrum of a certain domestic puree liquor brand, the concentration prediction model of acetic acid is studied. The main contents and innovations are as follows: Firstly, wavelet decomposition and derivative preprocessing are performed on the original spectrum. It is found that the first layer and the second layer of the wavelet mainly present the characteristics of noise, the concentration information is mainly distributed in the third and fourth layer signals. The intensity distribution of fluorescence emission spectra with different excitation wavelengths is different. At present, there is no unified method to select the appropriate excitation wavelength. According to wavelet decomposition signal, this article introduced effective signal strength and obtained the proper modeling excitation wavelength (200 nm). The derivative spectrum has more detailed features than the original spectrum, which can improve the spectral resolution. Secondly, the correlation between acetic acid concentration and fluorescence spectrum was studied. In general, the correlation between the original fluorescence spectrum and the concentration of acetic acid is not high. The correlation between the wavelet decomposition spectrum and derivative spectrum and the concentration is more than 0. 8 and shows more discrete correlation peaks. Therefore, the wavelet decomposition spectrum and derivative spectrum contain more information about the acetic acid concentration, which has a wider distribution than the original spectrum's. Finally, the partial least squares (PLS) multiple regression model of acetic acid concentration was studied based on fluorescence spectra and simulated annealing. The results show that the root means square error of the prediction set of acetic acid concentration in the original spectrum is as high as 70. 03 mg . L-1 so its model's effect is poor. Wavelet decomposition spectrum and derivative spectrum have better prediction effect because the multiple correlations between the spectra is reduced, and the resolution is improved. The second derivative spectral modeling is the best. The root mean square error of the prediction set is 20. 32 mg . L-1, and the correlation coefficient is 0. 9998. The spectral information density curve based on 1000 simulated annealing algorithms shows that the second derivative spectrum contains more acetic acid concentration information than the original spectrum. This study provides a simple optical method for predicting the concentration of substances in the year liquor.

It was consisted of a 1,4 linked alpha-D-Glcp backbone with the substitution at O-6 with 1,6-linked alpha-D-Glcp residue and non-reducing terminal of beta-Glc-1 -> through monosaccharide composition, IR, methylation, and NMR analyses. SEM, AFM, and particle size distribution measurements showed that HSP-W had relatively clustered spherical shape with different sizes from nanoscale to micrometer. Additionally, HSP-W significantly induced NO and ROS production as well as the release of IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha , and IL-6, and upregulated pinocytic and phagocytic capacities of THP-1 cells. Meanwhile, HSP-W treatment markedly enhanced mRNA and protein expressions of these cytokines. HS probably has potential application as an immunostimulatory agent. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The patterns of microbial community succession and flavor formation are highly similar among batches, yet the mechanisms promoting temporal succession in the Daqu microbial ecology remain unclear. Here, we first correlated temporal profiles of microbial community succession with environmental variables (temperature, moisture, and titratable acidity) in medium temperature Daqu (MT-Daqu) throughout fermentation. Temperature dynamics significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with the quick succession of MT-Daqu microbiota in the first 12 d of fermentation, while the community structure was relatively stable after 12 d. Then, we explored the effect of temperature on the MT-Daqu community assembly. In the first 4 d of fermentation, the rapid propagation of most bacterial taxa and several fungal taxa, including Candida, Wickerhamomyces, and unclassified Dipodascaceae and Saccharomycetales species, significantly increased MT-Daqu temperature to 55 degrees C. Subsequently, sustained bio-heat generated by microbial metabolism (53 to 56 degrees C) within MT-Daqu inhibited the growth of most microbes from day 4 to day 12, while thermotolerant taxa, including Bacillus, unclassified Streptophyta, Weissella, Thermoactinomyces, Thermoascus, and Thermomyces survived or kept on growing. Furthermore, temperature as a major driving force on the shaping of MT-Daqu microbiota was validated. Lowering the fermentation temperature by placing the MT-Daqu in a 37 degrees C incubator resulted in decreased relative abundances of thermotolerant taxa, including Bacillus, Thermoactinomyces, and Thermoascus, in the MT-Daqu microbiota. This study revealed that bio-heat functioned as a primary endogenous driver promoting the formation of functional MT-Daqu microbiota.IMPORTANCE Humans have mastered the Daqu preparation technique of cultivating functional microbiota on starchy grains over thousands of years, and it is well known that the metabolic activity of these microbes is key to the flavor production of Chinese baijiu. The pattern of microbial community succession and flavor formation remains highly similar between batches, yet mechanistic insight into these patterns and into microbial population fidelity to specific environmental conditions remains unclear. Our study revealed that bio-heat was generated within Daqu bricks in the first 4 d of fermentation, concomitant with rapid microbial propagation and metabolism. The sustained bio-heat may then function as a major endogenous driving force promoting the formation of the MT-Daqu microbiota from day 4 to day 12. The bio-heat-driven growth of thermotolerant microorganisms might contribute to the formation of flavor metabolites.

A two-stage model has been established to explain the formation and evolution of the NBS. The northward indentation of the Indian plate beneath the Lhasa terrane began at 55-40 Ma, and crustal materials at this corner were subducted to depths >70 km where they experienced HP (UHP?) metamorphism. Since 40 Ma, large-scale, right-lateral strike-slip along the Sagaing fault has accommodated the rapid northward movement of the eastern Indian plate corner with respect to the Indochina block. This caused significant and progressive bending of the Indus-Yarlung suture zone (IYSZ) such that it became the Dongjiu-Milin left-lateral, strike-slip, shear zone (DMSZ) in the west and the Aniqiao-Motuo right-lateral, strike-slip, shear zone (AMSZ) in the east. Both zones underwent strong mylonitization. Meanwhile, the HP (UHP?) metamorphic rocks were rapidly exhumed, first into the deep crust at 22-18 Ma and then to the shallow crust to form an antiformal dome at 6-2 Ma. Our model provides new insight into the processes of post-collisional crustal thickening related to the formation of the Himalayan orogenic belt.

Natural ventilation during Jiuqu fermentation causes changes in temperature, oxygen and moisture content, resulting in mass and heat gradients from the outer to inner areas of Jiuqu blocks. In the present study, microbiota stratification in Jiuqu was investigated by single molecule real-time sequencing and culture isolation. The contributors of Bacillus to amylase activity of Jiuqu and the dynamics of their biomass during Jiuqu fermentation were also analyzed.RESULTS The dominant orders, genera and species between the inner and outer layers of Huangjiu qu (HJQ) were similar, although they displayed greater variance in two layers of Baijiu qu (BJQ). Bacillus possessed the highest diversity (including 27 species) in Jiuqu. Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus altitudinis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus megaterium were most prevalent in HJQ, whereas B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus cereus were dominant in BJQ. Isolates of B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis and B. cereus exhibited high activities of amylase and glucoamylase.

Results indicated that the activities of amylase and protease between the inner and outer of fresh Daqu varied significantly while both parts became similar after maturation. The predominant bacteria shifted from Saccharopolyspora (outer) and Staphylococcus (inner) to Kroppenstedtia (both outer and inner), while the predominant fungi shifted from Thermoascus (both outer and inner) to Byssochlamys (outer) and Fusarium (inner). A combining analysis of headspace solid-phase micro extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance was employed to detect the metabolites.

When the CAPB consortium containing fermented mash was subjected to vacuum distillation, the distillation efficiency of ethyl caproate was up to similar to 300%, while the distillation efficiencies of the other flavour compounds and ethanol were <100%. The behaviour of ethyl caproate during the production and distillation of an ethyl caproate-rich rice shochu was investigated and the results showed that ethyl caproate was synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae during the shochu production process, and that some of the ethyl caproate synthesized was secreted into the medium. Ethyl caproate in the medium evaporated easily and was transferred to the distillate when distilled. The increase in ethyl caproate after distillation was mainly derived from the release of the intracellular ethyl caproate, with negligible input from the chemical esterification of caproic acid and ethanol. During vacuum distillation, although few yeast cells were disrupted, secretion of the intracellular ethyl caproate was more efficient owing to the increase in temperature, allowing the distillation efficiency of ethyl caproate to be >100%.

Ethyl acetate is not only the characteristically flavor components of Fen liquor, but also serves as important flavor component in Luzhou-flavor and Maotai liquors with relatively higher concentration. The method of determining esters including ethyl acetate has important practical significance. Chromatography exhibits some disadvantages because it often involves in complex operation and is very time-consuming. Nowadays, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has become an effective alternative to wet chemical methods in various fields such as food and pharmaceutical industry because it is simple, rapid, non-destructive, and capable of simultaneously analyzing several constituents, and it requires little or no sample preparation. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics proves to be a universal analytical technique.

The degree of inhibition of silver deposition was demonstrated to be strongly associated with the various components of white spirits, such as organic acids, aldehydes, ketones, and esters, which resulted in color differences and a consequent colorimetric response for different types of white spirits. The color differences could be recognized using principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The colorimetric sensor array was constructed by designing AuNRs with four different morphologies by utilizing different reducing agents to not only successfully distinguish various types of white spirits, including twelve types of strong-aroma-type spirits with similar flavor characteristics and different aroma-type spirits, but also to determine the concentration of the main ingredients affecting the quality of white spirits with a satisfactory linear range. Notably, the discriminating ability of the colorimetric sensor arrays was equal or superior than that of the untargeted metabolomic approach based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

When stored for 120 d,the saccharification power,liquefaction power, fermentation power,protease activity and esterification power were up to 700,0.8,0.8,40 and 20 U/g respectively. And the number of bacteria,yeasts,molds and spores were up to 1.4 * 10~7 CFU/g,1.9 * 10~5 CFU/g,2.0 * 10~5 CFU/g,5.6 * 10~7 CFU/g. The correlational analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between acidity and the number of bacteria. And the same tendency was also been showed between saccharification power and mold count,fermentation power and yeast count respectively. Meanwhile, there were negative correlations between water content and time, starch content and time,water content and ammonia nitrogen. This work offered reference data for future research on microbial flora and their multi-enzyme system in Daqu.

The evolution of microbiota in this spontaneous fermentation is controlled by the temperature profile, which reaches temperatures from 50 to 65 degrees C for several days. Despite these high temperatures, mesophilic Enterobacteriaceae (including Crono-bacter) and bacilli are present throughout Daqu fermentation. This study aimed to determine whether Daqu spontaneous solid-state fermentation selects for heat-resistant variants of these organisms. Heat resistance in Enterobacteriaceae is mediated by the locus of heat resistance (LHR). One LHR-positive strain of Kosakonia cowanii was identified in Daqu, and it exhibited higher heat resistance than the LHR-negative K. cowanii isolated from malted oats. Heat resistance in Bacillus endospores is mediated by the spoVA(2mob) operon. Out of 10 Daqu isolates of the species Bacillus licheniformis, Brevibacillus parabrevis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Bacillus velezensis, 5 did not contain spoVA(2mob), 3 contained one copy, and 2 contained two copies. The presence and copy number of the spoVA(2mob) operon increased the resistance of spores to treatment with 110 degrees C. To confirm the selection of LHR-and spoVA(2mob)-positive strains during Daqu fermentation, the copy numbers of these genetic elements in Daqu samples were quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The abundance of LHR and the spoVA(2mob) operon in community DNA relative to that of total bacterial 16S rRNA genes increased 3-fold and 5-fold, respectively, during processing. In conclusion, culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses suggest that Daqu fermentation selects for heat-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and bacilli.IMPORTANCE Daqu fermentations select for mobile genetic elements conferring heat resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and bacilli. The locus of heat resistance (LHR), a genomic island conferring heat resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, and the spoVA(2mob) operon, conferring heat resistance on bacterial endospores, were enriched 3- to 5-fold during Daqu fermentation and maturation. It is therefore remarkable that the LHR and the spoVA(2mob) operon are accumulated in the same food fermentation. The presence of heat-resistant Kosakonia spp. and Bacillus spp. in Daqu is not of concern for food safety; however, both genomic islands are mobile and transferable to pathogenic bacteria or toxin-producing bacteria by horizontal gene transfer. The identification of the LHR and the spoVA(2mob) operon as indicators of fitness of Enterobacteriaceae and bacilli in Daqu fermentation provides insights into environmental sources of heat-resistant organisms that may contaminate the food supply.",0099-2240,1098-5336,WOS:000447739600012,30120119,

To clarify the regulation effects of lipid metabolism and gut microbiota by huangjiu bioactive peptides, three huangjiu peptides were isolated, purified and characterized by hyper-filtration, macroporous resin, gel filtration separation and structural identification. Meanwhile, a mouse model of high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia was established to study the effects of huangjiu peptides on serum biomarker, hepatic metabolism and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Experimental results showed that huangjiu peptides T1 and T2 (HpT1, HpT2) treatment alleviated the increase in serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and aberrant hepatic lipid accumulation in the high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia mice. Furthermore, HpT2 and HpT1 restored the alpha-diversity and structure of gut microbial community after hyperlipidemia-induced microbiota disturbance compared with simvastatin and HpT3.

In this study, the aromatic characteristics of Chinese JingJiu have been identified using sensory analysis, aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA), and quantitative analysis techniques. The odor activity values (OAVs) were also used to characterize the compound. A total of 136 aroma compounds were identified through the AEDA and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC?MS) techniques. The flavor dilution (FD) factors were found to be in the range of 2?1024. Seventy aroma-active compounds with FD ? 8 were identified. Forty-three aroma-active compounds were identified using the molecular sensory science approach. Furthermore, 13 compounds were confirmed to be the key aroma-active compounds present in the Chinese JingJiu. The work provides a certain guiding effect on the regulation and optimization of the Chinese JingJiu production process.",0308-8146,1873-7072,WOS:000636068300004,33714803,

Nearly every town or village has a distiller to supply the demand. In rural China, distilling bai jiu is legal and regulated lightly or not at all. The World Health Organization estimates that as much as 25% of all alcohol consumed in China is unrecorded alcohol, of which an unknown portion is unrecorded bai jiu. Little is known about the composition of unrecorded Chinese spirits from rural parts of the country. This study focused on white spirits because the high ethanol (EtOH) concentration makes them more likely to contribute to health risks compared to other types of lower alcohol by volume (ABV) Chinese unrecorded alcohol.Methods: Researchers purchased samples of Chinese white spirits from small-factory distillers in central China. An independent laboratory conducted the analysis. Alcohol strength (ABV) was determined by hydrometer. Gas chromatography was used to determine the concentration of volatile organic compounds: EtOH, methanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and higher alcohols. Samples were tested for 3 heavy metals-arsenic, cadmium, and lead. We used the guidelines developed by the Alcohol Measures for Public Health Research Alliance (AMPHORA) of the European Commission to assess risk.Results: ABV ranged from 35.7 to 61.4%, and 58 of the 61 samples exceeded 40% ABV. The concentration of methanol, ethyl acetate, lead, arsenic, and cadmium was below AMPHORA guideline. The sum of higher alcohols exceeded the AMPHORA maximum in just 1 sample. Forty of the 61 samples had acetaldehyde levels beyond the AMPHORA guideline.Conclusions: The unrecorded Chinese alcohols we analyzed had a high EtOH concentration-a public health concern that is also presented by recorded alcohols. The high percentage of samples (65.5%) that had elevated acetaldehyde suggests the need to investigate the causes for this result and the need for steps to reduce acetaldehyde levels. The cumulative long-term risks of using high EtOH and high acetaldehyde Chinese spirits are heightened by the percentage of people in China who have a genetic trait for impaired acetaldehyde metabolism.",0145-6008,1530-0277,WOS:000393890700023,27984849,
